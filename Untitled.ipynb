      "Detective  Chief  Inspector  John  McLeish  gazed  doubtfully  at  the  plate  before  him\n",
      "Having  thought  he  was  hungry he  now  realized  that  actually  he  needed  anything  rather  than  the  overflowing  plate  of  cholesterol  the  canteen  at  New  Scotland  Yard  had  provided  with  such  admirable  promptness\n",
      "Sleep  would  perhaps  make  more  sense  after  thirty-six  hours  straight  on  duty much  of  it  spent  with  a  sullen  Jamaican  who  had  killed  his  landlady  and  her  three  children  in  the  crowded  kitchen  of  a  house  behind  the  Westway\n",
      "He  took  an  experimental  mouthful  of  fried  egg  and  waited  to  see  if  it  was  going  to  suit  him then  progressed  to  the  baked  beans cautiously\n",
      "He  finished  the  egg all  the  baked  beans  and  one  of  the  sausages but  decided  the  fried  bread  was  tempting  fate  and  pushed  the  plate  aside reaching  for  his  cup  of  tea resting  both  elbows  on  the  table\n",
      "He  lifted  a  hand  off  his  cup  in  weary  salute  to  one  of  his  sergeants.  a  very  dark  Scot  in  a  crumpled  grey  suit  who  was  walking  over  from  the  counter and  the  man  altered  course  to  sit  opposite  him\n",
      "How  goes  it Bruce\n",
      "Bruce  Davidson  had  accompanied  McLeish  from  his  last  posting  to  C1 that  division  of  New  Scotland  Yard  concerned  exclusively  with  murder and  they  had  now  worked  together  for  four  years  in  the  CID\n",
      "Got  that  Tottenham  case  weighed  off nae  bother\n",
      "I  hear  you 've  finished  the  Westway  job\n",
      "Ye  need  to  get  your  head  down John you 're  looking  rough\n",
      "McLeish  nodded\n",
      "He  had  glanced  in  the  washroom   mirror  and  it  had  not  been  a  reassuring  sight\n",
      "A  big  man six  foot  four  inches  in  his  socks  and  a  good  fourteen  stone he  always  looked  mildly  untidy and  this  morning having  worn  the  same  clothes  for  a  day  and  a  half  he  looked  like  a  football  supporter  after  a  night  in  the  cells\n",
      "At  thirty-two he  was  young  enough  not  to  look  completely  haggard even  after  thirty-six  hours  with  only  the  odd  hour 's  sleep but  his  dark  hair  was  plastered  to  his  head  and  the  brown  eyes  were  sunk  back  in  his  head  and  reddened  with  smoke  and  exhaustion\n",
      "I 'm  going  off\n",
      "You  too\n",
      "I 'm  waiting  for  Catherine  Sergeant  Crane\n",
      "Even  falling  asleep  as  he  was McLeish  was  amused  at  Bruce  Davidson 's  hopeful proprietorial  air\n",
      "Catherine  Crane  had  joined  the  division  three  months  ago creating  a  major  upheaval\n",
      "She  was  a  slight  young  woman  of  twenty-seven whose  dazzling delicate blond  looks  concealed  a  ferocious  intelligence  and  attack\n",
      "Every  man  in  her  vicinity  had  found  himself  putting  his  best  foot  forward and  she  had  done  wonders  for  the  sartorial  standards  of  the  notoriously  uncaring  C1  division\n",
      "McLeish  himself though  admiring had  been  unaffected he  had  been  in  love  for  over  a  year  with  a  young  woman  only  a  little  older and  even  cleverer than  Sergeant  Crane\n",
      "His  Francesca  was  a  rising  star  in  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry and  they  planned  to  celebrate  her  thirtieth  birthday  with  a  skiing  holiday due  to  start  in  two  weeks '  time\n",
      "He  smiled  on  Davidson cheered  immeasurably  by  the  thought  of  getting  on  a  plane  with  Francesca\n",
      "After  chatting  to  Davidson  for  a  few  minutes  longer he  went  back  to  his  office\n",
      "looking  for  his  secretary a  plumpish infinitely  competent middle-aged  mother  of  three\n",
      "She  was  on  the  phone  and  he  stood  silently filling  the  doorway raising  an  eyebrow  at  her\n",
      "She  motioned  him  to  stay\n",
      "It 's  Francesca John\n",
      "Thanks Jenny\n",
      "I 'll  take  it  back  there he  said brightening and  she  watched with  a  little  jealousy\n",
      "as  he  hurried  back  to  his  desk\n",
      "Darling\n",
      "I 've  got  a  horrendous  problem\n",
      "Can  you  possibly  duck  out  and  have  coffee  in  the  caff  in  ten  minutes\n",
      "The  voice  at  the  other  end  was  slightly  husky  but  very  clear\n",
      "It 's  Tristram\n",
      "He 's  been  arrested  in  New  York\n",
      "Better  not  talk  on  the  phone had  we\n",
      "Oh Christ\n",
      "No\n",
      "I 'll  meet  you\n",
      "He  put  down  the  phone rattled\n",
      "With  his  much-loved  Francesca  came  her  four  younger  brothers  for  whom as  the  eldest  child  of  a  widow she  had  always  considered  herself  responsible\n",
      "All  four  were  talented  musicians  and  difficult  people in  varying  degrees Tristram\n",
      "one  of  the  twenty-four-year-old  twins had  proved  the  most  difficult perhaps  because  he  was  not  the  most  talented\n",
      "McLeish  gritted  his  teeth and trying  not  to  consider  the  implications  of  what  he  had  been  told\n",
      "made  one  quick  phone  call then  took  the  lift  down  and  walked  across  the  road  from  New  Scotland  Yard  to  the  little  café  which  was as  usual full  of  workmen  engaged  in  rebuilding  the  offices  in  the  area\n",
      "Stopping  to  buy  a  paper he  caught  sight  of  Francesca  through  the  window perched  on  one  of  the  bar  stools totally  unconscious  of  the  table  full  of  men  next  to  her  all  eyeing  her  long  legs\n",
      "He  stood  and  watched  her putting  off  the  moment  when\n",
      "as  he  half  knew he  would  be  asked  to  acquiesce  in  some  lunatic  scheme  for  pulling  Tristram  out  of  trouble and  saw  her  for  a  moment  from  a  position  of  detachment a  tall  young  woman  looking  younger  than  her  twenty-nine  years\n",
      "dark with  a  long  straight  nose  and  arched  eyebrows\n",
      "She  was  looking  particularly  uncompromising  today tired  and  pale her  dark short  hair  spiking  up  at  the  back\n",
      "She  had  been  crying McLeish  observed  resignedly as  he  pushed  through  the  door\n",
      "All  right tell  me he  said as  he  sat  down  heavily  beside  her and  got  a  careful measuring\n",
      "sidelong  look\n",
      "I  have  to  go  to  New  York  in  a  hurry  and  bail  Tristram  out\n",
      "He  was  arrested  last  night with  one  of  the  backing  group  and  three  of  the  band\n",
      "They 're  all  in  the  nick\n",
      "charged  with  possession\n",
      "Cocaine as  I  understand  it\n",
      "Jesus\n",
      "I  know I  know just  when  he  was  beginning  to  be  a   success  like  Perry\n",
      "It  simply  went  to  his  head  you  know  what  he  was  like  when  he  left\n",
      "Thought  he  could  walk  on  water McLeish  said in  irritated  memory\n",
      "Frannie why  do  you  have  to  go\n",
      "He  has  a  manager  and  a  studio does n't  he\n",
      "What  can  you  do  that  they  ca n't\n",
      "She  sighed  so  heavily  that  her  whole  ribcage  moved\n",
      "I  am  to  some  extent  on  home  ground  there she  said reluctantly  and  not  looking  at  him\n",
      "Mike  Michael  O'Brien  will  help but  I  need  to  be  on  the  spot\n",
      "McLeish  held  on  to  his  temper reminding  himself  that  he  was  very  tired\n",
      "Francesca 's  much  publicized  affair  with  Senator  Michael  O'Brien  was  the  reason  that  she  had  been  sent  home  rather  early  from  a  tour  of  duty  in  the  Embassy  in  Washington over  a  year  previously just  before  he  had  met  her  in  London\n",
      "As  one  of  Francesca 's  DTI  colleagues  had  maliciously  observed it  had  been  felt  that  fraternization  with  the  American  colleagues  could  be  carried  too  far\n",
      "Francesca  herself  had  characteristically  taken  the  line  that  the  Foreign  Office  ought  to  have  been  glad  that  someone  on  the  staff  was  that  closely  involved  with  the  American  political  Establishment\n",
      "What  are  you  going  to  do  with  O'Brien\n",
      "Well I 'm  hardly  going  to  get  back  into  bed  with  him  after  more  than  a  whole  year\n",
      "There 'll  certainly  be  another  incumbent  by  now\n",
      "But  he  is  the  senior  Senator\n",
      "we  were  close  when  I  was  in  Washington and  whichever  way  you  slice  it  he  wo n't  want  my  brother  being  buggered  or  beaten  up  in  a  New  York  jail\n",
      "Her  classically  good  diction  always  became  even  clearer  under  stress so  that  this  statement  emerged  with  the  slightly  metallic  clarity  of  a  dubbed  film and  the  clientèle  of  the  small  café  was  obviously  appreciating  every  moment\n",
      "McLeish  decided  that  since  she  was  unaware  of  her  audience  it  did  not  become  him  to  be  selfconscious and  asked  what  she  expected  even  a  Senator  to  achieve  in  these  circumstances\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "darling\n",
      "The  American  legal  system  is  so  odd  that  I 've  been  told  I  could  get  Tristram  deported  in  my  custody\n",
      "It 's  a  disaster of  course  it  s  a  disaster he 'll  be  banned  from   the  US  for  ever  presumably but  at  least  he  wo n't  be  being  interfered  with  in  some  unspeakable  foreign  nick\n",
      "I  thought  he  was  off  drugs\n",
      "Well  we  all  hoped did n't  we\n",
      "But  evidently  he  is n't and  I  must  get  him  back\n",
      "McLeish  found  himself  on  the  verge  of  suggesting  that  a  thoroughly  unpleasant  time  in  a  New  York  jail  might  succeed  in  curing  Tristram  where  all  other  methods including  exhortation loving  family  support  and  a  spell  in  a  comfortable  private  hospital  in  Devon had  failed\n",
      "He  looked  at  his  love 's  shuttered miserable  face  and  realized  he  would  get  nowhere  along  those  lines\n",
      "Why  ca n't  your  Mum  or  one  of  the  boys  go\n",
      "Mum  is  in  bed  with  bronchitis as  you  would  know  if  you  had  managed  to  get  out  of  that  place  since  last  Friday\n",
      "Francesca a  true  eldest  child knew  how  to  score  her  points\n",
      "Charlie 's  baby  is  due  tomorrow Perry  is  in  Japan  on  tour just  like  all  the  papers  say\n",
      "Jeremy  is  coming  with  me  but  he  is  too  young  to  do  this  alone and  in  any  case  I 'm  the  only  one  who  can  deploy  O'Brien\n",
      "How  is  the  DTI  receiving  all  this\n",
      "You 've  got  four  rescue  cases\n",
      "Francesca  sighed\n",
      "They  are  as  fed  up  with  me  as  you  are but  they  wo n't  stop  me  taking  leave\n",
      "She  stopped  sharply and  blushed  scarlet\n",
      "Wait  a  minute\n",
      "John  McLeish  felt  his  blood-pressure  going  up\n",
      "What  about  skiing if  you 're  using  leave\n",
      "She  looked  at  him wretchedly\n",
      "I  have  to  go\n",
      "I  really  expect  to  get  back  in  three  or  four  days  and  I  will  try  and  hang  on  to  the  holiday\n",
      "I  know  we  need  it it  seems  ages  since  we  went  to  bed\n",
      "McLeish  scowled  round  the  fascinated  audience returning  the  customers  to  their  egg  and  chips\n",
      "Anyway it 's  been  you  who  have  been  too  busy  for  months\n",
      "McLeish  was  too  honest  not  to  acknowledge  the  point\n",
      "The  more  important then for  us  to  have  a  holiday  together\n",
      "I  know\n",
      "Darling I  am  sorry I  really  expect  to  be  back  inside  the  week and  I  would n't  go  if  anyone  else  could\n",
      "I  am  trying  I  mean  I  know  I  let  the  boys  lean  too  much\n",
      "He  looked  at  her defeated and  she  saw  that  she  had  carried  the  point but  at  a  heavy  cost\n",
      "Do  you  still  love  me she  asked  anxiously\n",
      "Not  at  the  moment\n",
      "An  indrawn  breath  from  the  spectators  unsettled  both  of  them  for  a  moment\n",
      "Francesca  nearly  laughed but  McLeish 's  expression  sobered  her\n",
      "Let's  get  out  of  here\n",
      "She  slid  obediently  off  the  bar  stool bidding  a  civil  good-morning  to  the  café  owner  who  looked McLeish  observed as  if  he  would  willingly  have  swept  her  into  his  plump  Italian  embrace and  they  walked  together  to  the  gates  of  New  Scotland  Yard\n",
      "I 'll  ring  you  when  I  get  to  New  York\n",
      "She  looked worried at  his  profile\n",
      "You 're  furious  with  me\n",
      "I 'm  sorry\n",
      "I  love  you\n",
      "I  do n't  think  we  can  go  on  like  this\n",
      "McLeish  surprised  himself  as  well  as  her\n",
      "John\n",
      "It  was  an  appeal  and  he  was  not  proof  against  it\n",
      "He  bent  and  kissed  her\n",
      "I  am  furious and  I  want  you  back  quickly\n",
      "But  good  luck  with  it  ring  me  if  you  need  help\n",
      "The  look  she  flicked  him  reminded  him  that  this  was  one  area  where  she  would  not  appeal  for  his  help she  had  been  more  than  careful  to  protect  him  from  any  involvement  with  a  drug-taking  brother\n",
      "It  was  one  of  her  many  advantages  that  as  a  professional  civil  servant  herself  she  understood  the  constraints  of  his  career\n",
      "She  turned  to  go head  down\n",
      "McLeish  saw  that  she  was  crying  again but  decided  coldly  there  was  nothing  he  was  going  to  do  and  trudged  wearily  back  to  the  lift the  morning 's  cheerfulness  totally  evaporated\n",
      "I 'm  so  sorry Miss  Morgan  is n't  in  today\n",
      "Would  you  like  to  speak  to  her  assistant\n",
      "The  receptionist like  everything  else  in  the  glass-walled  hall was  immaculately  clean glossy highly  fashionable  and  faintly  reminiscent  of  an  Italian  restaurant\n",
      "The  young  woman  in  the  plain  suit  was  not  intimidated  by  it nor  by   the  hand-carved  plate  that  proclaimed  her  to  be  in  the  offices  of  Yeo Davis  and  Partners\n",
      "But  I 'm  having  lunch  with  her she  said\n",
      "It  was  arranged  some  time  ago\n",
      "If  you 'll  just  wait  a  minute I 'll  ask  someone  to  come  and  talk  to  you\n",
      "The  immaculate  receptionist 's  manner  was  fraying  a  little discomfort  with  the  situation  showing  like  the  edge  of  a  petticoat\n",
      "She  looked  across  the  hall  and  visibly  relaxed  as  she  saw  a  man  moving  swiftly  down  the  staircase\n",
      "Peter\n",
      "The  man  altered  course  impatiently  to  deal  with  the  interruption just  under  six  foot he  looked  smaller  because  of  the  width  of  the  powerful  sloping  shoulders  which  even  good  tailoring  could  do  little  to  minimize\n",
      "He  looked  sharply  at  the  receptionist  in  enquiry suppressed  energy  in  his  every  movement\n",
      "This  is  Miss  Huntley  who  was  supposed  to  be  having  lunch  with  Angela  today\n",
      "The  tall  young  woman  blinked  as  the  man  turned  the  full  power  of  his  attention  on  her\n",
      "Have  you  talked  to  Angela  this  week\n",
      "She  stared  at  him\n",
      "Well no she  said but  there  was  no  need  I  mean  we  had  fixed  up  lunch  last  week\n",
      "Is  she  not  here\n",
      "No\n",
      "No  she  is n't I 'm  afraid\n",
      "I 'm  very  sorry  she  did n't  let  you  know\n",
      "He  was  clearly  preoccupied  but  Miss  Huntley  was  not  willing  to  let  him  go\n",
      "You 're  her  boss\n",
      "I 'm  the  senior  partner yes\n",
      "Peter  Yeo\n",
      "She  had  his  attention  back and  noticed  how  good-looking  he  was  with  those  bright  blue  eyes  and  brown  skin  against  the  black  hair\n",
      "Rather  heavy  in  the  neck but  an  attractive  man\n",
      "He  looked  back  thoughtfully  at  her taking  in  the  brown  eyes the  long none-too-clean  hair and  the  patchy  make-up  through  which  broken  veins  in  the  cheeks  were  showing\n",
      "Late  twenties  perhaps but  did n't  make  much  of  an  effort\n",
      "So  how  do  I  get  hold  of  her the  woman  enquired fretfully voice  rising  out  of  control\n",
      "Perhaps  we  should  talk  somewhere  less  public he  suggested and  showed  her  hastily  into  his  office\n",
      "What  has  happened  to  Angela then\n",
      "Miss  Huntley  asked  anxiously and  he  decided  to  make  the  best  of  a  bad  job\n",
      "She  has n't  been  in  at  all  this  week\n",
      "And  it  is  now  Thursday\n",
      "But  she 's  very  high  up  here is n't  she\n",
      "He  blinked\n",
      "She 's  a  partner yes\n",
      "You  must  have  talked  to  her  family\n",
      "Well I  waited  a  couple  of  days\n",
      "Then  I  talked  to  everyone\n",
      "Her  fiancé  has  now  reported  her  as  a  missing  person I  believe\n",
      "Giles  Hawick\n",
      "The  Minister\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Sorry but  were  you are  you  close  to  her\n",
      "My  uncle  used  to  employ  her\n",
      "William  Coombes\n",
      "I  do  know  her  quite  well\n",
      "She  sounded  indignant  and  resentful and  he  slowed  up  deliberately\n",
      "Ah\n",
      "I  have  heard  her  speak  of  him\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "He  died  two  years  ago\n",
      "I  had  remembered\n",
      "He  was  pouring  coffee  and  she  watched  his  thick well-manicured  hands\n",
      "I  need  to  see  her\n",
      "Both  of  them  were  taken  aback  by  the  force  with  which  she  said  it  and  she  blushed  red\n",
      "I  do n't  know  where  she  is he  admitted reluctantly\n",
      "I  was  disappointed  when  I  found  you  did n't  either\n",
      "Oh darling hello do  come  in\n",
      "Since  he  now  sounded  flustered Penelope  Huntley  looked  with  interest  at  the  intruder a  good-looking slightly  overweight  woman  probably  in  her  early  forties carefully  dressed  but  uncertain\n",
      "Darling this  is  Miss  Huntley who  was  expecting  to  lunch  with  Angela  today\n",
      "Miss  Huntley my  wife Claudia  Yeo\n",
      "I 've  just  been  explaining  that  Angela  seems  to  have  gone  missing\n",
      "I  think  everyone  is  probably  making  far  too  much  fuss and  Angela  has  just  taken  off  for  a  few  days '  holiday\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  looked  momentarily  furiously  exasperated\n",
      "Giles  Hawick  is  taking  it  seriously  enough  to  have  reported  her  as  a  missing  person he  said  tightly\n",
      "His  wife  gave  him  a  long  level  look  with  no  liking  in  it  at  all and  Penelope  Huntley  watched fascinated\n",
      "Are  we  lunching Peter\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  jerked  into  action\n",
      "Of  course\n",
      "Look Miss  Huntley I 'm  afraid  we  are  rather  preoccupied\n",
      "If  you  ring  us  tomorrow  we  may  know  more\n",
      "I 'm  so  sorry  she  is n't  here\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley who  would  very  much  have  liked  to  have  gone  on  with  the  discussion found  herself  swept  out  of  the  office and  walked  slowly  down  the  road flushed  with  a  mixture  of  disappointment  and  excitement\n",
      "In  New  Scotland  Yard  John  McLeish  was  trying increasingly  irritably to  clear  his  desk  so  he  could  go  home\n",
      "Bruce  Davidson  was  making  a  meal  of  explaining  a  straightforward  case  essentially  because  he  was  trying  to  impress  Catherine  Crane\n",
      "Not  that  he  was  succeeding Sergeant  Crane  was  sitting legs  crossed only  just  not  fidgeting as  Bruce  Davidson  wore  on  through  a  lot  of  unnecessary  detail\n",
      "It  was  unprecedented  for  any  woman  to  have  that  effect  on  Davidson whose  success  in  this  field  was  legendary\n",

      "These  had  to  be  answered and  answered  well  or  at  least  the  first  ten  or  so  did  because  the  original  questioner  and  other  MPs  were  allowed  to  ask  supplementary  questions\n",
      "Once  you  got  down  to  Question  11 the  questioner  would  get  a  deeply  unhelpful  written  response  which  would if  the  civil  servants  knew  their  business leave  no  one  any  the  wiser\n",
      "Endearingly Francesca  herself  was  not  good  at  drafting  that  sort  of  answer  and  usually  had  to  enlist  a  more  senior  colleague  to  achieve  the  correct  polished  hand-off\n",

      "I  suppose  we  are  right  to  send  you  and  Jeremy  out  to  get  Tristram  rather  than  leave  him  to  take  the  full  consequences he  said  reflectively as  he  loaded  her  and  her  possessions  into  his  car  and  took  the  wheel\n",

      "McLeish  knew  roughly  what  it  would  be  like  from  Francesca 's  description  of  her  own  Department but  he  was  still  interested  in  the  controlled  bustle  in  the  big  untidy  room\n",
      "The  Private  Secretary a  dark stocky  man  a  couple  of  years  McLeish 's  junior greeted  him observing  cautiously  that  they  had  surely  met  at  Francesca  Wilson 's  house\n",

      "The  Minister  is  just  finishing  a  phone  call then  I  must  tell  him  one  thing  before  he  sees  you he  said briskly glancing  at  the  miniature  switchboard  beside  him  which   sat  incongruously  in  the  draughty high-ceilinged dingy  room\n",
      "A  light  flicked  off and  he  knocked  and  disappeared  into  his  master 's  office leaving  McLeish  and  Catherine  by  his  desk\n",

      "The  Treasury  exists  to  stand  in  front  of  the  safe shouting  Go  away and  making  threatening  gestures  at  any  Department  who  comes  near  it  or  them  he  remembered  Francesca 's  clear amused  voice  explaining  the  system\n",
      "But  in  the  end  they  get  pushed  over they  just  manage  to  delay  the  bigger-spending  Departments  a  bit And  they  pop  up  again good  as  new the  next  time like  a  row  of  skittles\n",
      "The  Private  Secretary  Michael  Marsden he  remembered  with  an  effort  signalled  them  from  the  door  and  McLeish  moved  forward keen  to  see  what  the  kingpin  of  this  row  of  skittles  looked  like\n",
      "His  first  thought as  he  shook  the  hand  of  the  distinctive  dark  man  almost  as  tall  as  himself was  that  Francesca  must  have  got  it  wrong  this  time\n",
      "Giles  Hawick  was  not  the  sort  of  man  you  could  flatten  easily and  if  you  managed  it he  would  not  pop  up bright smiling  and  bearing  no  grudge to  face  you  the  next  ti  me\n",
      "If  you  injured  this  one it  would  be  as  well  to  kill  him  before  he  killed  you\n",

      "The  high arched  eyebrows  in  the  long  bony  face  rose  slightly  in  surprise but  no  more\n",
      "The  immediate  impression  of  directed  dominance  did  not  come  from  the  man 's  physique impressive  though  that  was McLeish  decided  as  he  accepted  the  offered  chair  and  placed  Catherine  at  the  side  of  the  room\n",

      "Nor  were  the  very  deep-set  dark  brown  eyes  particularly  hypnotic as  journalists  occasionally  suggested\n",
      "It  was  the  controlled economical  force  that  emanated  from  the  man  that  was  impressive and  the  speed  with  which  he  absorbed  information\n",
      "In  about  two  minutes  he  had  established  precisely  which  members  of  C1  he  was  dealing  with  and  why\n",
      "John  McLeish himself  a  forceful  character felt  as  if  he  had  been  put  through  a  wringer\n",
      "He  waited out  of  long  experience  with  dominant  characters until  a  natural  break  occurred  and  used  it  to  ask  for  some  background starting  with  how  long  the  Minister  had  known  Miss  Morgan\n",
      "Giles  Hawick looking  surprised sat  more  easily  in  his  chair  and  started  to  marshal  his  thoughts\n",

      "Miss  Angela  Morgan I  mean\n",
      "Early  on  Saturday  morning  about  eight-thirty\n",
      "I  did n't  expect  to  see  her  again  until  late  on  Monday  I  went  off  to  do  some  walking  for  the  weekend  and  was  taking  an  extra  day\n",
      "I  rang  her  on  Monday  night  and  got  no  answer but  that  did n't  worry  me\n",

      "Perhaps  I  should  have  done  it  before but  I  suppose  one 's  always  afraid  of  making  a  fool  of  oneself\n",
      "McLeish  decided  it  was  unlikely  that  that  sort  of  consideration  very  much  exercised  this  cool  customer\n",

      "He  showed  them  into  the  lift shaking  hands  with  them  both and  as  Catherine  turned  away  from  him  to  press  the  lift  button he  suddenly  raised  his  eyebrows  at  McLeish  in  amusement  at  his  own  response  to  her\n",

      "He  had  the  look  of  a  man  with  a  nasty  temper  if  you  got  on  his  wrong  side\n",

      "I  agree\n",
      "I  do n't  like  the  sound  of  it  at  all\n",
      "The  best  we  could  hope  for  is  that  she 's  had  a  brainstorm and  I  do n't  know  how  often  that  happens  outside  of  books\n",
      "Anyway we  need  to  get  back  and  get  the  procedures  into  place\n",

      "He  stood  aside  for  McLeish then  took  himself  off observing  unnecessarily  that  he  just  had  a  wee  bit  paperwork  to  finish  up\n",

      "What\n",

      "Who  is  it\n",
      "A  girl  called  Francesca  Wilson who  is  doing  work  that  involves  rescuing  dud  companies  which  employ  a  lot  of  people  in  difficult  areas\n",

      "Well that  is  easy  enough  for  you is n't  it\n",
      "Are  you  seeing  her  tonight\n",
      "McLeish  scowled reminded\n",
      "No she 's  in  New  York\n",
      "He  glanced  sideways  at  Catherine  Crane 's  unchanged  expression  which  showed  merely  courteous  interest and  decided  to  sit  down  and  talk\n",
      "Francesca 's  got  four  brothers see two  of  them  professional  singers two  of  them  by  the  grace  of  God  ordinary  working  stiffs  in  respectable  offices\n",
      "He  paused trying  to  decide  how  to  go  on noticing  how  dirty  the  walls  of  the  small dark  office  looked  against  Catherine  Crane 's  neat pale  suit  and  bright  blond  hair\n",

      "Good  question\n",
      "Fran 's  gone  to  make  sure  no  one  lays  a  finger  on  a  brother that 's  what  it  is\n",
      "They 're  like  that\n",
      "He  brooded  for  a  moment sighed and  reached  for  the  list  again\n",
      "I 'll  be  able  to  talk  to  her  sooner  or  later and  it  sounds  as  if  she  might  actually  be  useful\n",
      "She 'll  at  least  be  able  to  explain  Yeo  Davis  to  us\n",
      "Anything  else  on  Miss  Morgan\n",
      "Catherine  Crane  moved  one  tidy  package  of  paper neatly  tabulated in  search  of  an  equally  tidy  pile and  McLeish  watched  with  pleasure\n",
      "Keeping  the  paperwork  straight  might  not  be  glamorous  but  it  was  eighty  per  cent  of  the  battle  as  he  well  knew and  he  made  certain  his  staff  did  too\n",
      "It  did n't  look  as  if  that  particular  conversation  was  going  to  be  necessary  in  this  case\n",

      "A  lively arrogant  face rather  square eyes  wide-set and  a  full curving  mouth\n",
      "Dark  brown  hair dark  brown  eyes and  slightly  sallow  skin  which  the  photographer  had  not  bothered  to  disguise  or  retouch having  understood  that  this  was  part  of  her  charm\n",
      "Not  a  true  beauty but  the  girl  beckoned  you  off  the  paper confident sexy that  face  invited  you  to  join  in  if  you  could  stand  the  pace\n",
      "A  handful McLeish  thought but  a  lot  of  fun\n",
      "He  reached  for  the  CV  while  Catherine  Crane  busied  herself  systematically  with  her  papers\n",
      "Same  age  as  Francesca and  had  attended  the  same  good  North  London  all-girls '  grammar  school for  entry  to  which  aspiring  parents  would  have  been  prepared  to  pay  blood-money  had  there  been  anyone  in  the  austere  intellectual  governing  body  and  teaching  staff  who  would  have  taken  it\n",

      "Even  among  perhaps  a  hundred  girls  in  their  year they  must  have  known  each  other  quite  well\n",
      "Their  ways  had  diverged  at  university  Angela  Morgan  had  gone  on  to  Oxford  to  read  English the  fatherless  Francesca under  more  pressure  to  make  a  living had  gone  to  Cambridge  to  read  law\n",
      "A  clever  girl though Miss  Morgan an  Exhibitioner  like  Francesca  and  a  respectable  second-class  degree\n",
      "He  considered  the  arrogant attractive knowing  face  again  and  put  the  photo  down shifting  his  attention  to  Catherine 's  pale classic  beauty\n",
      "He  was  about  to  divide  up  responsibility  for  checking  Angela  Morgan 's  last  recorded  movements  when  Bruce  Davidson  knocked  and  put  his  head  in\n",
      "John\n",
      "It 's  Francesca on  the  phone  from  New  York says  will  you  hurry\n",
      "McLeish  jogged  down  the  passage overcoming  irritation\n",
      "Of  course  he  had  the  sense  to  hurry  when  she  was  hanging  on  a  line  from  New  York\n",
      "Talk  more  slowly he  said in  exasperation after  the   first  few  seconds\n",
      "She  was  sounding  strained and  as  always  when  she  was  over-extended  she  was  being  unnecessarily  bossy\n",
      "Her  sigh  of  exasperation  reached  him  from  3,000  miles  away\n",

      "I  need  to  talk  to  you too\n",
      "What  about\n",
      "Francesca  sounded  rattled  and  hostile and  McLeish  gazed  at  the  wall wondering  if  he  had  really  been  in  love  with  her  for  over  a  year\n",
      "About  someone  called  Angela  Morgan  whom  you  or  another  F.  Wilson  at  the  DTI  had  lunch  with  a  couple  of  weeks  ago\n",
      "She 's  been  reported  missing  and  we 're  checking  her  movements  for  the  two  weeks  before  she  vanished\n",
      "A  dead  silence  ensued  and  he  shook  the  phone\n",

      "Sorry yes\n",
      "It  was  me\n",
      "But  why  are  you  doing  this John\n",
      "Do  you  think  she 's  dead\n",
      "Well at  least  Francesca 's  mind  appeared  to  be  functioning  on  a  subject  unconnected  with  her  damned  brothers McLeish  thought  grimly\n",
      "Not  necessarily\n",
      "She  was  reported  missing  by  her  fiancé\n",

      "And  she  is n't\n",
      "Not  as  of  an  hour  ago no\n",
      "She 's  gone  off  with  another  bloke bet  you  anything\n",
      "McLeish  grinned  at  the  telephone\n",
      "I  did n't  think  she  was  one  of  your  mates\n",
      "But  you  were  at  school  with  her\n",
      "Yes  I  was but  we  were  never  that  close\n",
      "Different  subjects  for  a  start\n",
      "There  was  a  pause  while  she  gathered  her  thoughts  and  McLeish  waited  patiently\n",
      "What  do  you  know  about  her John\n",
      "Bugger  all at  the  moment\n",
      "I 've  got  a  photograph\n",
      "Then  you  know  quite  a  lot if  it  is  a  good  one\n",
      "Of  all  the  women  I  know she  is  by  far  the  most  successful  with  men even  though  she  is n't  the  best-looking\n",
      "She  is  the  original  man-trap\n",
      "John  McLeish  blinked  at  the  telephone\n",
      "Francesca 's  judgement  was  typically  over-judicial  and  conscientiously  unemotional but  this  had  real  force  behind  it\n",
      "He  had   never  heard  Francesca  giving  vent  to  feminine  jealousy  and  on  the  whole  he  found  the  experience  refreshing\n",
      "You 'd  better  explain  to  me  what  it  is  she  does  as  a  job\n",
      "Hang  on  I 'll  ring  you  back the  Yard  can  pay  this  bill\n",
      "That 's  all  right I 'm  in  a  mate 's  office\n",
      "Well I  hope  the  Senator  can  afford  it\n",
      "I 'm  sure  he  can\n",
      "A  real  advantage  of  his  girl McLeish  thought  grimly was  that  she  never  lied  if  asked  directly\n",
      "She  might  not  volunteer  the  truth  all  the  time but  ask  her  and  you  got  a  straight  answer\n",
      "Angela  is  a  lobbyist\n",
      "Francesca  made  it  sound  like  someone  who  came  to  clean  the  telephone\n",
      "That 's  not  what  Yeo  Davis  call  themselves  I  think  they  use  some  phrase  like  government  and  parliamentary  relations\n",
      "They  help  clients  to  push  the  right  buttons  in  government  in  the  UK  and  increasingly of  course in  the  EEC\n",
      "It 's  a  perfectly  respectable  trade she  added  conscientiously\n",
      "I  do n't  mind  lobbyists I 'd  just  rather  they  called  themselves  by  their  proper  name  as  they  do  in  Washington rather  than  wittering  on  for  hours  about  relationships  with  opinion-formers\n",
      "Angela  got  up  my  nose  as  usual  on  this  point  over  lunch banging  on  about  the  importance  of  seeing  that  Ministers  were  properly  informed  and  by  the  right  people\n",
      "as  if  the  Civil  Service  spent  all  its  time  obfuscating  issues  and  introducing  Ministers  to  the  wrong  people\n",
      "McLeish  decided  that  it  was  probably  not  the  moment  to  suggest  to  her  that  the  real  reason  any  civil  servant  disliked  lobbyists  must  be  that  the  chaps  were  paid  to  make  sure  Ministers  got  a  view  other  than  the  Departmental  one\n",
      "Can  you  give  me  an  example  of  what  they  do\n",
      "I  mean why  was  Miss  Morgan  having  lunch  with  you or  was  that  just  for  old  time 's  sake\n",
      "No no I  now  rank  as  an  important  contact a  senior  opinion-former or  so  she  flatteringly  told  me\n",
      "It  was  quite  a  good  example  of  lobbying in  fact\n",
      "It 's  widely  known  because  the  unions  have  publicized  it  that  the  Department  is  looking  at  bailing  out  Huerter  Textiles\n",
      "Henry  and  I  are  doing  it as  the  resident  textile  rescue-squad\n",
      "You  just  have n't  heard  about  it  because  you 've  been  too  busy\n",
      "Trust  Francesca  to  get  her  points  in  while  she  could McLeish  thought  irritably\n",
      "And  her  firm  is  working  for  Huerter\n",
      "No no quite  the  contrary\n",
      "Her  firm Yeo  Davis is  working  for  Barton  Mills which  is  the  other  really  big  surviving  textile  company  in  the  north-west\n",
      "Their  chief  executive Andy  Barton feels with  some  reason  one  would  have  to  say that  it  is n't  right  that  the  government  should  bail  out  a  competitor\n",
      "The  point  is  darling that  in  order  to  make  sure  Huerter  has  a  future we  would  have  to  put  a  lot  of  money  in  to  restore  a  bombed-out  balance  sheet\n",
      "Barton  has  heavy  borrowings  too and  to  put  it  crudely if  they 're  paying  interest  and  Huerter  is n't Huerter  ought  to  be  able  to  undercut  them  in  the  market\n",
      "So  Miss  Morgan  was  making  sure  you 'd  understood  all  that\n",
      "I  see  where  it  annoyed  you\n",
      "Francesca  was  not  amused\n",
      "Yes well it  is  an  offensively  elementary  consideration  and  one  to  which  Ministers '  attention  had  been  drawn\n",
      "Yeo  Davis  seem  to  have  felt nonetheless that  it  was  worth  a  lunch\n",
      "She  paused\n",
      "I 'd  have  to  say  that  given  the  change  of  government  they  ought  to  have  a  very  good  chance  of  preventing  us  assisting  Huerter\n",
      "I  mean this  lot  did  come  in only  six  months  ago announcing  that  everyone  would  have  to  stand  on  their  own  feet  and  not  be  rescued and  face  up  to  competition and  all  that\n",
      "But  whatever  they  said as  you  know  they  have n't  actually  done  any  of  it  yet  they  did  rescue  Fryers  and  Towyn  Metals using  tax-payers '  money just  like  they  said  they  would n't\n",
      "Yeo  Davis  could  have  credibly  warned  Barton  that whatever  the  public  statements there  was  a  real  risk  that  Huerter  would  be  bailed  out\n",
      "McLeish  considered  this Are  lobbyists  well  paid\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Not  that  Angela  needed  the  money\n",
      "Rich  girl is  she\n",
      "Very\n",
      "She  did n't  earn  it  in  any  conventional  sense her  last  employer  left  one  third  of  his  substantial  fortune  to  her  outright and  another  third  for  life\n",
      "His  family  a  sister  and  niece  as  I  remember  was  awfully  cross\n",
      "This  was  about  two  years  ago\n",
      "McLeish  told  Francesca  to  hang  on  while  he  got  this   down  as  a  note and  stared  at  the  result\n",
      "It  made  a  good  reason  for  those  excluded  to  dislike  Miss  Morgan but  it  had  been  true  any  time  these  past  two  years\n",
      "When  you  had  lunch how  was  she\n",
      "I  mean it  did n't  sound  as  if  she  had  plans  to  go  off  with  someone  else\n",
      "In  the  silence  at  the  other  end  of  the  line  he  heard  Francesca  think\n",
      "No she  did n't  come  over  like  that not  at  all\n",
      "In  fact she  was  excited  in  an  innocent  way  about  the  wedding  plans\n",
      "Reception  at  the  House all  very  grand  and  smart\n",
      "And  awfully  good  for  her  business too\n",
      "McLeish  smiled  to  himself  at  the  swift  fall  from  grace  in  the  postscript\n",
      "Prodding  gently he  got  Francesca  to  run  through  the  substance  of  the  lunch-time  conversation\n",
      "It  was  clear  that  Miss  Morgan 's  brain  had  been  fully  engaged  on  what  she  was  doing which  was  pushing  a  client 's  interest and  that  such  attention  as  she  could  spare  from  that  had  been  centred  on  her  forthcoming  marriage\n",
      "Nothing  at  all  there five  days  before  her  disappearance to  suggest  she  was  planning  to  vanish\n",
      "Francesca 's  attention  would  have  been  undivided  as  well as  that  lunch  had  taken  place  before  Tristram  had  managed  to  get  himself  so  comprehensively  into  trouble\n",
      "McLeish  remembered  abruptly  Francesca 's  chief  preoccupation\n",
      "How  are  you  getting  on  over  there he  asked cautiously\n",
      "Much  fixing  is  going  on\n",
      "I 'm  basically  just  biting  my  fingernails  and  holding  Tristram  together\n",
      "He  has  been  bailed  on  several  sureties  and  appears  in  court  tomorrow\n",
      "She  was  sounding  terse  and  McLeish  decided  not  to  ask  her  any  more  details  over  the  transatlantic  phone\n",
      "I 've  told  them  here  I  do n't  need  the  week  after  next  off he  said as  levelly  as  he  could\n",
      "Oh John\n",
      "She  sounded  appalled\n",
      "I 'd  managed  to  hang  on  to  it\n",
      "Why  ever  did  you  do  that\n",
      "How  was  I  supposed  to  know he  said instantly  aware  that  he  had  acted  too  hastily  because  he  had  been  so  angry  with  her\n",
      "Well I  said  I 'd  call  you\n",
      "I  ought  to  be  home  in  three  days  and  I 've  made  a  deal  with  Henry\n",
      "That  was  just  plain  bloody-minded  of  you\n",
      "Coming  from  you that 's  ridiculous\n",
      "A  combination  of   justified  annoyance guilt  and  weeks  of  overwork  blew  John  McLeish 's  temper  to  shreds  instantly and  Francesca seriously  over-stressed  and  not  one  to  duck  a  quarrel  at  the  best  of  times responded  in  kind\n",
      "She  banged  the  phone  down  a  second  before  he  did leaving  him  raging\n",
      "Ten  minutes  later  he  had  calmed  down  sufficiently  to  make  himself  a  cup  of  coffee  and  write  himself  a  note  to  check  Angela  Morgan 's  financial  status\n",
      "He  bethought  himself  guiltily  of  Sergeant  Crane who  might  be  assumed  to  be  waiting  to  continue  the  conversation  that  Francesca 's  call  had  interrupted and  padded  down  the  corridor\n",
      "Her  office  was  now  marked  by  a  frieze  of  officers two  lounging  half  in  and  half  out  of  her  door a  third  a  little  behind the  attention  of  all  three  directed  entirely  towards  her  desk\n",
      "Two  of  the  three  moved  off  as  he  arrived with  unconvincing  references  to  waiting  papers but  Bruce  Davidson  stood  his  ground enquiring  heartily  how  Francesca  was  and  had  she  been  helpful\n",
      "McLeish  considered  him  with  something  between  amusement  and  irritation\n",
      "Bruce  was  pale  with  the  deep  pallor  that  overworked  CID  tend  to  acquire  in  London  in  the  dead  of  winter seriously  overtired  and  overweight\n",
      "But  he  was  alert  and  sparkling his  motor  well  and  truly  turned  on  by  the  presence  of  Catherine  Crane and  he  probably  was n't  going  to  go  home  till  he or  Catherine dropped  in  their  tracks\n",
      "She  was  fine and  yes  she  was he  said dealing  with  Bruce 's  formal  question\n",
      "And  it 'll  all  wait  till  the  morning\n",
      "Go  home Bruce or  back  to  whatever  your  case  is and  I 'll  have  a  word  with  Sergeant  Crane\n",
      "He  nodded  decisively and  equally  firmly  walked  into  her  office  and  closed  the  door  on  Davidson 's  hopeful  face\n",
      "Sorry but  that  phone  call  was  useful\n",
      "He  ran as  dispassionately  as  he  could through  Francesca 's  account  of  her  lunch  with  Angela  Morgan\n",
      "So  she  probably  did n't  vanish  voluntarily Catherine  Crane  said in  summary\n",
      "It  does n't  sound  like  it\n",
      "He  looked  unseeingly  at  the  beautiful  face  across  the  table hearing  the  echo  of  his  quarrel  with  Francesca feeling  his  mind  still  chuntering  on  in  justification  of  the  anger  that  had  led  him  to  cut  off  all   possibility  of  their  holiday  next  week\n",
      "Well he  had  been  fed  up and  why  should n't  he  be\n",
      "He  was  fed  up  with  the  whole  situation and  all  Francesca 's  family\n",
      "Sir  John is  there  anything  more  tonight\n",
      "He  came  back  smartly  to  the  office  and  the  desk  on  which  he  was  leaning\n",
      "No sorry\n",
      "Have  you  eaten  since  lunch\n",
      "A  sandwich  and  lots  of  coffee  which  Sergeant  Davidson  brought\n",
      "I 'm  fine\n",
      "I 'm  not\n",
      "I 'm  going  to  get  something  at  the  pub  on  my  way  home\n",
      "Come  with  me\n",
      "Thank  you I 'd  like  to\n",
      "She  smiled  at  him  and  he  smiled  back cheered  by  the  thought  of  a  drink  and  something  to  eat  in  her  company\n",
      "He  collected  her  as  soon  as  they  had  both  tidied  their  offices McLeish  maliciously  enjoying  Davidson 's  obvious  chagrin  as  they  said  good-night  to  him  on  the  way  out\n",
      "A  good  man that he  said guiltily to  Catherine  as  they  went  down  in  the  lift\n",
      "One  of  the  best\n",
      "I  want  to  get  him  up  to  Inspector  as  soon  as  possible\n",
      "He  has  been  very  helpful\n",
      "McLeish  repressed  a  grin  and  bustled  into  the  big  noisy  pub  on  the  corner receiving  an  instant  acknowledgement  from  one  of  the  bartenders who  all  knew  any  member  of  the  C1  hierarchy\n",
      "McLeish  carried  over  a  loaded  tray and  ate  ravenously noting  with  interest  that  Catherine  Crane  had  an  equally  good  appetite though  it  was  not  obvious  where  she  was  putting  it  on  that  slim  frame\n",
      "She  caught  his  eye  and  laughed\n",
      "I  have  to  eat  about  five  times  a  day or  I  just  stop  in  my  tracks\n",
      "She  licked  her  fingers  and  applied  herself  to  her  beer\n",
      "Like  Francesca McLeish  thought and  irritably  suppressed  the  reflection\n",
      "Tell  me  about  you\n",
      "Did  you  do  all  your  time  in  the  Met or  did  you  start  up  north\n",
      "No I  came  straight  to  the  Met  from  school  at  eighteen\n",
      "Left  home  as  soon  as  she  could McLeish  observed instead  of  starting  where  she  could  work  from  home\n",
      "Do  you  still  have  family  in  wherever  it  is  Stoke  on  Trent\n",
      "Yes they 're  still  there\n",
      "She  was  looking  wooden and  McLeish  decided  to  move  off  this  point but  she  forestalled   him\n",
      "It 's  my  stepfather  and  mother  and  four  half-brothers  and  sisters\n",
      "My  dad  was  killed  at  work  when  I  was  three\n",
      "Does n't  get  on  with  stepfather McLeish  noted  mentally listening  to  the  colour  in  her  voice\n",
      "Where  are  you  living  now\n",
      "I 've  just  bought  a  flat\n",
      "McLeish  asked  whereabouts  and  discovered  it  was  three  roads  away  from  his  own  flat so  they  complained  enjoyably  to  each  other  about  the  local  council\n",
      "You  were  a  graduate  entry were n't  you she  asked  as  this  conversation  ran  out and  in  the  Flying  Squad\n",
      "McLeish warmed  by  the  fact  that  she  had  taken  the  trouble  to  find  out  a  bit  about  him confirmed  he  had  been  at  Reading  University  and  had  worked  as  a  young  sergeant  in  the  Flying  Squad\n",
      "I  always  heard  graduates  were n't  welcome  there\n",
      "That 's  right\n",
      "The  guv'nor  there when  he  was  offered  me wanted  quite  seriously  to  know  what  use  I  would  be\n",
      "It 's  changing  now\n",
      "But  they  took  me  in  then  because  one  of  my  mates  in  the  London  Scottish  was  in  the  Squad\n",
      "They  gave  me  a  bad  time  they 'd  all  been  in  since  they  were  seventeen  and  they  were  hard  men\n",
      "But  I  got  by  on  brute  force  and  ignorance  till  I  learnt  a  bit\n",
      "She  gave  him  a  quick  amused  glance her  head  leaning  back  against  the  faded  red  of  the  alcove  seat\n",
      "The  man  who  brought  you  in  to  the  Squad  must  have  been  Alan  Jones\n",
      "He  was  my  guv'nor  in  Tottenham  and  he  said  you  were  all  right\n",
      "McLeish  beamed  at  her more  than  pleased  with  this  recommendation\n",
      "How  is  old  Alan\n",
      "She  settled  down  to  tell  him  how  old  Alan  was  while  he  leant  forward listening  with  pleasure  to  the  slightly  nasal  accent  of  Stoke  on  Trent\n",
      "Her  judgement  of  Alan  Jones  was  both  admiring  and  shrewd and  he  asked  about  her  own  education becoming  aware  that  at  least  four  other  men  were  listening  with  great  interest  and  that  Catherine  Crane  was  so  used  to  this  that  she  was  unconscious  of  it\n",
      "I  came  in  with  three  A  levels she  said matter  of  factly\n",
      "I  was  at  Queen  Eleanor 's  and  they  urged  me  to  go  to   university but  I  wanted  to  be  independent so  I  came  into  the  Met\n",
      "McLeish  nodded his  impression  of  family  difficulty  confirmed\n",
      "What  were  your  grades\n",
      "Three  As\n",
      "English history  and  economics\n",
      "Better  grades  than  mine McLeish  said impressed\n",
      "Do  the  lads  get  at  you too\n",
      "Yes a  bit\n",
      "She  laughed  at  him the  pretty  mouth  opening  to  reveal  small even  teeth\n",
      "But  I  do n't  have  a  posh  set  of  in-laws  like  you  do\n",
      "McLeish more  sharply  than  he  had  meant pointed  out  that  he  had  a  girlfriend  but  not  a  wife\n",
      "This  is  a  good  pub she  said hastily obviously  aware  of  having  trespassed her  gaze  passing  over  the  heavy  plush  seating  and  lighting  on  one  of  the  barmen  who  was  openly  resting  his  eyes  on  her  as  he  polished  glasses\n",
      "We  use  it  a  lot\n",
      "He  followed  her  gaze  and  the  barman  lifted  his  right  hand  in  a  drink-pouring  gesture nodding  at  the  same  time  towards  the  clock  which  showed  five  minutes  to  eleven\n",
      "McLeish  indicated  equally  economically  that  no  more  drinks  would  be  required\n",
      "I 've  got  my  car  in\n",
      "Would  you  like  a  ride  home he  asked\n",
      "If  it 's  not  out  of  your  way she  said serenely knowing  that  it  was n't and  McLeish  got  to  his  feet savouring  self-consciously  the  sensation  of  being  whole-heartedly  envied  by  the  surrounding  male  drinkers\n",
      "He  drove  her  sedately  home\n",
      "Getting  out  to  open  the  passenger  door  for  her he  noticed  that in  contrast  to  Francesca she  expected  this  and  accepted  the  courtesy  gratefully\n",
      "I 'll  wait  while  you  let  yourself  in he  said in  an  attempt  at  sounding  policeman-like and  she  smiled  at  him\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "And  thanks  for  the  ride\n",
      "She  had  her  key  ready  and  he  looked  down  at  her  for  a  minute\n",
      "She  looked  back her  eyes  wide and  he  found  himself  holding  his  breath\n",
      "Good-night John she  said demurely and  walked  up  her  front  steps turning  to  wave  to  him  from  inside  the  house\n",
      "The  boy  and  the  dog  skirted  round  opposite  sides  of  the  puddle the  boy a  light tall  fourteen-year-old labouring  in  wellington  boots  too  large  for  him and  the  dog a  three-year-old  Labrador  bitch picking  her  way  reluctantly with  frequent  pauses as  if  her  paws  hurt\n",
      "The  boy unlike  the  dog knew  that  the  mud  did  not  go  on  for  ever beyond  the  bridge the  disused  railway  embankment  along  which  they  were  walking  became  built  up so  that  water  ran  off  it\n",
      "He  pulled  the  dog  close  to  him  to  let  a  mixed  string  of  horses  and  Ponies  go  past waving  shyly  to  the  lead  rider a  pretty capable  girl  an  unbridgeable  two  years  older  than  him\n",
      "He  watched  her  as  she  went  past  at  a  walk the  black  Labrador  and  he  both  gazing  wistfully their  breath  steaming  in  the  cold  February  morning\n",
      "He  waited  till  the  horses  were  well  away  and  looked  round  the  wide flat  landscape  carefully  before  unclipping  the  lead\n",
      "Way  you  go Patty he  said  softly and  the  dog  was  off hurling  herself  along  the  embankment all  paws  and  flying  ears after  a  rabbit  who  had  been  sitting  in  a  patch  of  sun  but  disappeared  with  contemptuous  ease  as  she  came  close\n",
      "The  boy  had  been  told  unequivocally  not  to  let  her  off  the  lead  the  riding-school  only  used  the  land  by  grace  of  its  owner  and  it  was  a  shooting  estate  but  he  hated  keeping  the  dog  straining  at  the  lead  and  knew  that  she  would  always  come  to  his  call\n",
      "He  stood  for  a  moment  laughing  at  her  as  she  cast  furiously  for  the  vanished  rabbit and  walked  on to  catch  her  up along  the  raised  embankment\n",
      "The  trees  had  grown  up  beside  it  in  the  twenty-five  years  since  the  railway  had  closed and  the  boy  stopped  every  now  and  then  to  watch  small  birds  hopping  around  the  top  branches\n",
      "He  particularly  liked  this  stretch nothing  but  the  odd  tractor  and  the  horses  ever  came  down  this  embankment and  the  birds  were  unworried  by  his  presence\n",
      "After  half  a  mile  he  decided  to  turn  off  the  embankment  and  walk  up  the  side  of  the  next  field  and  along  the  path  at  the  top  of  it following  the  horses  whom  he  could  still  see  in  the  distance\n",
      "He  called  Patty  to  him\n",
      "She  did n't  come which  was  surprising she  was  a  docile  creature  and  particularly  devoted  to  him  because  he  always  took  her  for  a  walk  when  he  was  at  the  stables\n",
      "He  could  hear  her  barking  and  looked  down  over  the  steep  side  of  the  embankment  to  the  bottom  of  the  trees\n",
      "He  called  her  again  and  again but  she  would  not  stop  barking  at  something  he  could  not  see\n",
      "Probably  a  squirrel he  decided and  slithered  down  the  side  of  the  embankment  to  join  her scolding  as  he  went\n",
      "Straightening  up  beside  the  dog he  looked  where  she  was  looking and  blinked\n",
      "He  saw  a  leg uncomfortably  wedged  between  sapling  trees swollen  grotesquely and  gazed  at  it stupidly wondering  if  it  was  plastic\n",
      "As  his  eyes  focused  he  realized  he  was  looking  at  a  hideously  swollen  human  body and  just  then as  the  light  breeze  shifted he  caught  the  stomach-turning  odour  of  decay\n",
      "He  was  a  sensible  and  capable  boy an  eldest  child so  he  moved  closer trying  not  to  breathe and  stood  steadfastly  looking  until  he  was  confident  of  what  he  had  seen a  body must  be  a  girl  because  it  was  wearing  a  skirt lying  face  down head  towards  the  bottom  of  the  embankment  as  if  she  had  dived  off  the  top\n",
      "He  clipped  the  lead  on  to  the  dog  with  cold  hands  which  would  hardly  function and  let  her  pull  him  up  the  slope  as  fast  as  he  could  make  his  legs  move\n",
      "He  stopped  on  the  embankment shaking  with  cold  and  shock to  note  the  spot then  fled  along  the  tractor  paths the  dog  running  with  him to  the  stables  where  the  ten  o'clock  children 's  ride  was  in  its  closing  stages\n",
      "Miss  Williams\n",
      "Jamie I 'm  teaching\n",
      "The  thin capable  woman  who  was  taking  the  riding-class  looked  at  him  in  amazement  as  he  leaned  panting  on  the  gate  to  the  ring the  dog  whining  beside  him\n",
      "I 'm  sorry\n",
      "Please I 've  found  something I  must  tell  you\n",
      "She  had  known  him  since  he  was  a  very  small  five-year-old perched  like  a  mosquito  on  one  of  the  placid  beginners '  ponies so  she  told  the  class  to  carry  on  walking  their  ponies  while  she  came  to  him\n",
      "There 's  someone  dead\n",
      "Below  the  railway  embankment\n",
      "Are  you  sure\n",
      "The  boy  looked  at  her  and  uncontrollable  tears  suddenly  filled  his  eyes\n",
      "He  was  very  nearly  as  tall  as  her but  she  put  an  arm  under  his  shoulders  and  supported  him  to  the  untidy  room  which  served  as  the  stable  office calling  to  one  of  the  stable  girls  to  take  over  the  class\n",
      "Patty  found  her\n",
      "She 's  just  lying  there but  she  is  dead\n",
      "He  scrubbed  at  his  face  with  the  handkerchief  she  offered  and  gulped  for  air\n",
      "I 'll  ring  the  police\n",
      "She  did  so casting  an  experienced  eye  over  him\n",
      "Sit  down  here Jamie and  I 'll  make  some  tea\n",
      "Mummy  will  come  back  in  a  few  minutes wo n't  she for  Susie\n",
      "Not  Mummy\n",
      "Aunt  Margaret  is  coming  at  ten\n",
      "The  boy  thought  longingly  of  his  mother but  managed  to  help  Miss  Williams  describe  the  location  of  the  body  to  a  startled  local  station  sergeant  and  to  drink  a  cup  of  sweet  milky  tea  without  being  sick\n",
      "By  the  time  his  aunt  arrived  Jamie  was  so  far  recovered  as  to  be  able  to  refuse  to  go  home  and  to  point  out severely that  he  would  be  needed either  to  assist  the  police  or  to  be  lead  rider  in  the  eleven-thirty  class or  possibly  both\n",
      "He  watched  his  aunt  and  Miss  Williams  wordlessly  consult  each  other but  knew  his  aunt  would  do  as  she  was  told successful  solicitor  though  she  was she  was  ten  years  younger  than  Miss  Williams  and as  she  complained totally  intimidated  by  her  as  she  had  not  been  by  anyone  since  her  late  headmistress\n",
      "He  was  unsurprised  to  find  her  packed  off  firmly  to  take  his  sister  home leaving  him  as  a  person  of  major  importance  in  what  he  instantly  assumed  to  be  a  real  murder\n",
      "Miss  Williams  took  him  to  meet  the  police  Land  Rover  at  the  stable  gate a  bone-thin wiry  woman  in  her  late  fifties her  expression  sufficiently  forbidding  to  prevent  the  parents edging  cars  through  the  gate  to  collect  children   from  the  ten  o'clock  ride from  asking  any  questions\n",
      "Jamie through  a  renewed  queasiness just  observed  that  the  police  driver  was  instantly  reduced  to  half  his  age  by  Miss  Williams 's  greeting\n",
      "He  was  one  of  my  boys she  said  in  explanation  to  the  CID  sergeant  who  was  leading  the  party  as  they  bumped  over  the  rough  road through  the  thick  mud  and  on  to  the  dry  embankment\n",
      "Like  Jamie  here\n",
      "Did  you  recognize  the  person  you  found young  man the  sergeant  asked carefully\n",
      "No\n",
      "Tears  started  into  Jamie 's  eyes\n",
      "She  was  all  swollen\n",
      "The  sergeant 's  eyes  widened and  he  slid  out  of  the  Land  Rover  and  stood  back  to  let  Jamie  out\n",
      "Very  competent  boy\n",
      "Almost  a  professional  singer handles  himself  very  well\n",
      "Miss  Williams 's  natural  pitch well  suited  to  reaching  across  a  hunting-field was  discreetly  reduced\n",
      "The  CID  sergeant  thanked  her  gravely  and  went  to  stand  beside  Jamie  who  was  peering  down  the  embankment looking  pinched\n",
      "We 'll  go  down  together lad\n",
      "There  is n't  room\n",
      "I 'll  lead\n",
      "He  took  a  deep  breath  and  headed  down the  sergeant two  constables  and  Miss  Williams  in  his  wake\n",
      "Soon  they  all  stood  side  by  side one  of  the  younger  policemen  coughing  involuntarily\n",
      "Oh  dear oh  dear Miss  Williams  said  on  an  indrawn  breath\n",
      "Sorry\n",
      "Come  along Jamie let's  get  you  back\n",
      "She  took  out  a  handkerchief  and  mopped  her  eyes\n",
      "The  police  driver  shot  Jamie  a  look  of  enquiry  which  he  missed occupied  as  he  was  with  guiding  Miss  Williams  back  up  the  hill\n",
      "He  had  seen  her  weep  before  but  only  for  a  sick  horse and  he  was  awe-struck\n",
      "Jamie did  you  let  Patty  off  the  lead\n",
      "The  boy  blushed  to  his  ears  and  owned  to  it\n",
      "You  must  not  do  it Jamie we 'll  be  in  trouble  with  Colonel  James I 've  told  all  you  boys  a  thousand  times\n",
      "He 'll  perhaps  not  do  it  again the  sergeant  murmured and  received  the  look  that  Miss  Williams  habitually  bent  on  a  child  who  was  riding  carelessly\n",
      "How  long  had  she  been  there\n",
      "Jamie  asked anxiously\n",
      "A  few  days the  sergeant  said grimly\n",
      "How  many\n",
      "Doctor 'll  tell  us\n",
      "He  considered  the  boy  thoughtfully and  decided  to  take  him  back  quickly\n",
      "These  teenagers  were  in  his  experience  a  lot  less  tough  than  they  looked\n",
      "Any  idea  who  it  could  be he  asked  Miss  Williams  casually\n",
      "No\n",
      "But  only  a  local  would  know  to  put  a  body  there\n",
      "If  Jamie  had n't  let  the  dog  off  the  lead  she  could  have  been  there  much  longer\n",
      "The  sergeant  nodded deciding  it  could  do  no  harm  to  concede  a  point  he  had  already  taken\n",
      "No  one  could  tell  who  she  was surely\n",
      "Miss  Williams  said  quietly  to  him sounding  shaky\n",
      "She  did n't  even  look  human\n",
      "The  sergeant  confirmed  that  that  happened  with  bodies  after  a  few  days\n",
      "We 'll  identify  her though he  said reassuringly\n",
      "Somebody  will  likely  have  reported  her  missing\n",
      "He  stopped abruptly as  he  remembered  a  conversation  earlier  that  week and  lit  a  cigarette thinking  furiously\n",
      "This  could  be  the  girl  whom  the  Yard  were  looking  for and  he  had  better  do  everything  very  quickly  indeed including  finding  his  Chief who  would  then  want  to  find  his  Chief  Constable  and  notify  Scotland  Yard\n",
      "Presumably  it  would  be  the  Yard  who  investigated  this  one rather  than  the  regional  crime  squad\n",
      "He  chewed  his  thumbnail  as  he  walked out  of  long  experience  keeping  in  mind  the  highest  priorities Ensure  Body  Not  Moved  and  Ensure  Next  of  Kin  Notified  before  the  Press  got  the  story\n",
      "He  posted  the  detective  constable  he  had  with  him  back  down  the  path  to  join  his  colleague armed  with  instructions  to  repel  all  attempts  by  anyone however  senior  or  armed  with  whatever  authority to  go  anywhere  near  the  body  unless  he Sergeant  Black personally  accompanied  them\n",
      "Then  he  climbed  into  the  Land  Rover  beside  his  two  passengers  and  drove  off  fast with  the  aim  of  abandoning  Jamie  to  the  custody  of  his  aunt  as  quickly  as  possible\n",
      "He  could  see  with  half  an  eye  that  the  kid 's  aunt  was  going  to  be  one  of  the  confident bossy well-connected  women  with   whom  that  part  of  Cambridgeshire  was  substantially  over-provided\n",
      "John  McLeish  was  in  his  office Saturday  or  no  Saturday telling  himself  he  needed  to  catch  up  on  the  paperwork\n",
      "The  phone  rang  and  he  picked  it  up frowning\n",
      "One  of  the  pleasures  of  Saturday  working  was  that  the  phone  did  not  ring  all  the  time\n",
      "The  voice  at  the  other  end  was  plainly  over-excited  and  it  took  him  a  minute  to  disentangle  what  he  was  being  told\n",
      "Oh  congratulations Charlie\n",
      "Sorry what  did  you  say  it  was  again\n",
      "A  little  girl\n",
      "Actually  a  very  big  girl  as  these  things  go nine  pounds\n",
      "It 's  fantastic John there  she  is a  new  person lying  on  her  face sound  asleep\n",
      "I 've  just  left  them  and  I 'm  going  back\n",
      "McLeish  repressed  the  malicious  thought  that  this  event  might  put  Francesca 's  nose  just  a  little  bit  out  of  joint\n",
      "She  had  been  utterly  secure  in  her  position  as  the  only  girl  in  the  Wilson  family  and  now  there  was  another  one\n",
      "I 've  got  another  bit  of  good  news\n",
      "Frannie 's  going  to  be  able  to  bring  Tristram  home  pretty  soon apparently\n",
      "McLeish  expressed  qualified  enthusiasm  and  Charlie  assured  him  he  felt  exactly  the  same  about  his  younger  brother\n",
      "The  difficulty  is  that  Perry  does  everything  that  bit  better  than  Tristram\n",
      "Not  that  this  is  any  excuse John I  do  know\n",
      "He  paused reminding  McLeish  irresistibly  of  a  Labrador  wondering  how  best  to  approach  an  acquaintance\n",
      "I  wanted  to  say you  see that  I  know  you  thought  Frannie  should n't  have  gone and  that  it 's  ruined  your  holiday  plans and on  behalf  of  us  all I 'm  sorry\n",
      "I  know  the  little  boys  lean  on  her  too  much  and  I  would  have  gone  if  I  could\n",
      "He  coughed embarrassed  and  a  little  pompous very  much  conscious  of  his  new  status  as  a  father while  McLeish  remembered  that  he  was  a  scant  four  years  older  than  the  delinquent  Tristram\n",
      "Anyway  she  should  be  back  soon Charlie  concluded\n",
      "McLeish  thanked  him  gravely feeling as  he  often  did  with  the  Wilsons that  he  was  being  enveloped  in  a  large   feather  eiderdown and made  restless  by  the  call went  down  the  corridor  to  where  he  knew  Catherine  Crane  was  also  in getting  her  office  in  order\n",
      "He  stopped  at  the  door  and  smiled  at  her\n",
      "Wearing  jeans  and  a  blue  shirt she  was  tugging  at  a  filing  cabinet  which  was  too  large  for  her  to  embrace  and  which  was  threatening  to  over-balance  on  her\n",
      "She  looked  about  sixteen  and  beautiful\n",
      "She  let  go  of  the  cabinet coughing  in  the  dust  of  ages  that  appeared  to  be  lurking  behind  it and  smiled  back  at  him  as  the  February  sun  shone  through  the  small  window  behind  her throwing  into  sharp  relief  the  patches  on  the  wall  where  her  predecessor  had  hung  posters and  the  ingrained  dirt  on  the  flaking  paintwork  round  the  mean narrow metal  window\n",
      "Where  do  you  want  that  put\n",
      "McLeish  advanced  on  the  cabinet  and  shifted  it  authoritatively ignoring  the  clip  on  the  ankle  dealt  him  by  an  unsecured  bottom  drawer  apparently  full  of  bricks\n",
      "I  should  have  unloaded  it  first Catherine  Crane  said apologetically but  I  just  could n't  move  in  any  direction  with  it  where  it  was\n",
      "I 'm  here just  tell  me  if  you  want  anything  else  shifted\n",
      "He  hesitated\n",
      "I 'm  going  to  do  another  hour then  have  some  lunch if  you  want  to  come\n",
      "He  was  aware  that  he  was  not  managing  to  sound  exactly  like  a  senior  officer  making  a  recent  arrival  feel  at  home but  decided  not  to  add  any  further  riders  to  his  invitation\n",
      "That  would  be  very  nice\n",
      "Are  we  going  to  the  canteen\n",
      "Not  if  I  can  help  it\n",
      "What  about  the  pub\n",
      "If  I 'm  allowed  to  buy  my  own\n",
      "McLeish  considered\n",
      "That 's  fine  on  the  food  I 'll  buy  the  drinks I 'm  too  old  to  get  used  to  women  buying  my  drinks\n",
      "She  laughed  at  him  and  said  gravely  that  she  would  be  happy  to  indulge  him and  he  went  away grinning\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  was  also  in  his  office having  told  his  wife  he  was  lunching  with  a  client\n",
      "It  was he  felt just  too  difficult  to  be  at  home  at  all with  Claudia  in  a  permanently  bitchy  mood  and  both  his  teenage  children  taking  their  cue  from  her  and   behaving  intolerably\n",
      "He  wandered  restlessly  about and  decided  that  the  lie  might  as  well  become  the  truth\n",
      "Without  Angela  Morgan at  least  two  major  clients  were  in  danger  of  not  getting  the  assiduous  service  they  were  paying  for and  it  would  be  well  worth  trying  to  see  if  one  of  them whom  he  knew  to  be  a  fellow  refugee  from  family  life  at  the  weekends could  be  found\n",
      "He  was  in  luck and  fixed  to  meet  Andy  Barton  at  Brazzo 's  where  Yeo  Davis  had  a  table  permanently  booked\n",
      "He  had  to  admit  that  this  particular  client  hardly  added  to  the  general  decorative  smartness  of  the  place\n",
      "Andy  Barton founder  and  chief  executive  of  Barton  Textiles was  almost  as  broad  as  he  was  long virtually  neckless with  incongruously  long  brown  hair  curling  over  his  collar\n",
      "His  enormous  hands  dwarfed  the  elegant  menu  which  he  was  studying  in  apparent  disbelief and  Peter  Yeo  noticed  again as  Barton  without  rising  extended  one  massive  paw that  though  the  fingers  were  an  ordinary  length  it  was  the  width  of  the  palms  that  made  the  hands  so  large\n",
      "I  never  see  how  they  get  the  sales  per  square  foot  in  these  places Barton  observed without  further  greeting\n",
      "I  mean they 're  not  open  twelve  hours  like  my  shops and  they  are n't  using  the  space\n",
      "His  small  bright  blue  eyes  swept  disparagingly  over  the  minimalized  black  and  white  flooring stainless  steel  chairs  and  black  wooden  bar\n",
      "They  make  a  huge  margin  on  a  smaller  turnover Andy out  of  punters  like  us\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  was  amused  by and  respectful  of a  man  with  an  obsession\n",
      "Angela  not  working  today\n",
      "Barton  worked  a  sixteen-hour  day which  began  with  careful detailed  consideration  of  the  trading  figures  and  key  ratios  for  every  one  of  his  forty-three  major  shops  and  the  output  of  both  factories and  continued usually  by  helicopter with  a  detailed  aerial  survey  of  a  particular  area  as  the  quick  way  of  identifying  new  sites interspersed  with  unheralded  descents  on  the  manager  of  any  shop  he  took  a  fancy  to  visit\n",
      "Peter  Yeo who  had  known  this  particular  juggernaut  since  he  had  his  first  small  factory  and  two  stores  and  dirt   under  his  fingernails  from  shifting  packing-cases  personally was  not  fazed  by  the  question\n",
      "Angela 's  taking  a  few  days  off  she  has n't  been  well he  said easily\n",
      "I  know  she 's  been  working  very  hard  for  you\n",
      "I 'm  up  to  speed  with  Huerter of  course but  is  your  planning  application  in  Leicester  all  right\n",
      "Barton  assured  him  warmly  that  Angela  had  done  a  great  job  and  he  was  now  confident  of  getting  planning  permission  on  the  vast  site  he  had  wanted\n",
      "Peter  Yeo who  knew  him  in  this  over-candid over-emphatic  mood decided  to  prod  gently\n",
      "Angela  said  the  council  wanted  it  for  housing\n",
      "Yeah some  of  them  did\n",
      "Silly  buggers it 's  jobs  they  want  there  first\n",
      "Plenty  of  housing  if  those  stupid  farts  at  the  council  got  round  to  repairing  it  and  stopped  their  tenants  tearing  apart  what  they  have  got\n",
      "My  Mum  brought  up  five  of  us  in  a  flat  far  worse  than  what  these  immigrants  complain  about\n",
      "Peter  Yeo who  had  personally  persuaded  Barton  of  the  presentational  disadvantage  of  using  words  like  darkies niggers or  wogs decided  that  immigrants even  though  used  in  the  manner  of  one  invoking  a  curse was  as  good  as  he  was  going  to  get  with  this  particular  client\n",
      "She 's  doing  a  good  job  on  sorting  this  Huerter  thing too\n",
      "Bloody  ridiculous  them  blokes  at  the  DTI  pushing  assistance  for  Huerter\n",
      "I  voted  for  this  government  because  they  said  they  were n't  going  to  go  in  for  that  sort  of  rubbish\n",
      "No  one  ever  gave  me  anything  and  my  business  works\n",
      "Still Angie  can  fix  the  Treasury  on  this  one given  her  boyfriend ca n't  she\n",
      "That 's  the  reason  I  wanted  you  on  this\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  winced  inwardly but  he  was  not  going  to  tell  Andy  Barton  that  Angela  was  missing or  express  any  of  his  reservations  about  how  much  influence  Angela  could  bring  to  bear\n",
      "He  smoothly  changed  the  subject  to  the  looks  of  the  blond  model three  tables  away and  Barton  agreed  he  would n't  mind  a  bit  of  that on  the  thin  side mind  you but  tasty\n",
      "The  rest  of  lunch  passed  in  similar  diversion interspersed  with  details  of  last  week 's  turnover  which   were  never  far  from  Barton 's  mind whatever  other  distractions  offered\n",
      "Mrs  Huntley  was  having  lunch  with  her  daughter\n",
      "She  ate  placidly acknowledging  to  herself  with  her  customary  good  sense  that  at  the  moment as  at  any  time  since  her  brother  William  had  died she  and  Penelope  were  getting  no  pleasure  at  all  from  each  other  's  company\n",
      "Penelope  was  looking  particularly  discontented  and  disaffected picking  at  her  food\n",
      "Her  red  suit  was  smart but  too  bright  a  colour  for  her  pale  English  pink  and  white  skin her  brown  hair  could  have  done  with  a  wash  and  her  nails  were  ragged  and  bitten\n",
      "She  was  frowning deep  lines  appearing  between  her  eyebrows mouth  drawn  down  at  the  edges  so  that  instead  of  a  classically  good-looking  slim  English  Rose  in  her  late  twenties she  looked  faded years  older  than  her  real  age and  shrewish\n",
      "Mrs  Huntley  sighed her  brother  whom  she  had  loved but  knew  to  be  self-indulgent  to  a  fault had  done  his  niece  real  harm  by  leaving  so  much  of  his  money  away  from  the  girl  who  had  confidently  believed  herself  to  be  his  favourite  thing  on  earth\n",
      "Penelope however it  had  to  be  acknowledged had  made  no  attempt  to  rise  above  the  blow  she  had  been  dealt  by  finding  a  dazzling  girl  of  her  own  age  favoured  over  herself  in  her  uncle 's  will\n",
      "At  least Mrs  Huntley  thought  hopefully she  had  stopped  wondering unbecomingly  and  stridently how  her  uncle  could  have  been  fooled  by  Angela  Morgan\n",
      "It  was  Grizel  Huntley 's  own  view  that  her  brother  had  not  been  fooled  at  all  but  had  been  charmed  and  diverted  by  a  dashing  girl  thirty  years  his  junior and  had  seen  no  reason  at  all  why  she  should  not  have  a  share  of  his  considerable  estate  when  that  left  a  very  decent  down-setting  for  his  niece  as  well\n",
      "Indeed she  had  respected  Angela  Morgan  for  the  straightforwardness  with  which  she  had  tackled  the  issue  when  they  had  met  at  the  lawyer 's  office\n",
      "I 'm  sorry  you 're  disappointed she  had  said  to  Penelope but  after  all  there 's  a  lot  of  money quite  enough  for  both  of  us\n",
      "So  there  was Grizel  Huntley  acknowledged and  it  would  be   a  great  deal  better  if  Penny  could  manage  to  think  a  bit  more  positively\n",
      "If  she  has  vanished I 'm  going  to  see  that  solicitor  about  whether  I  can  get  her  presumed  dead\n",
      "Penny sounding  childishly sullenly  determined broke  into  her  mother 's  thoughts\n",
      "Grizel  Huntley  looked  across  at  her shocked\n",
      "I  would  wait  a  little  if  I  were  you\n",
      "Penelope  glared  at  her turning  an  ungraceful  scarlet but  Mrs  Huntley  held  her  ground\n",
      "You  are  being  silly  about  this Penny\n",
      "You  are  letting  this  disappointment  and  that 's  all  it  is you 're  still  a  very  well-off  young  woman  get  in  the  way  of  everything\n",
      "Penelope  choked  on  her  pudding  and  started  to  cry angry uncontrollable  tears\n",
      "Grizel  Huntley  reached  out  to  comfort  her  but  she  forced  back  her  chair  and  fled clutching  her  handbag  and  napkin leaving  her  mother  with  the  ruins  of  lunch\n",
      "Fifty  miles  north Sarah  Morgan  had  just  finished  serving  a  lunch  that  no  one  had  done  more  than  pick  at\n",
      "Her  husband  Francis  had  made  a  slightly  better  showing  than  her  daughter  Jennifer who  was  looking  particularly  ragged\n",
      "Mother  and  daughter  were  very  like  each  other tall dark slim pleasant-looking  women  with  mid-brown  curly  hair  and  slightly  snub  noses\n",
      "Francis  Morgan by  contrast was  dark almost  black-haired sallow-skinned with  bright  brown  eyes\n",
      "Of  medium  height  and  packed  with  energy even  distressed  as  he  was he  was  bursting  round  the  kitchen hair  still  damp  at  the  back  from  his  swim\n",
      "Let's  go  to  the  flicks\n",
      "No  point  at  all  sitting  round  looking  at  each  other\n",
      "Come  on  Jennifer  or  are  you  going  out  with  Michael\n",
      "He 's  gone  back  to  Australia Dad\n",
      "Last  week\n",
      "Jennifer  sounded  defeated and  he  looked  at  her  sideways  with  familiar  love  and  exasperation\n",
      "She  just  did n't  seem  to  be  able  to  hang  on  to  men he  thought  impatiently not  like  his  Angie wherever  she  was\n",
      "Giles  rang  up his  daughter  volunteered and  he  was  uncomfortably  reminded  by  something  in  her  voice  that   Giles  Hawick  was  one  of  the  men  Jennifer  had n't  been  able  to  hang  on  to  or  not  once  he  had  seen  Angela\n",
      "How  was  he his  wife  Sarah  asked rather  too  quickly\n",
      "Well very  worried\n",
      "He  said  the  police  were  talking  to  everyone  Angie  had  seen  in  the  two  weeks  before  she well vanished and  so  far  had  come  up  with  nothing\n",
      "I  mean  no  one  noticed  anything  unusual  about  her  and  she  seemed  to  be  full  of  plans  for  the  wedding\n",
      "Well I  told  them  that Francis  Morgan  said  irritably  and  his  wife  and  daughter  caught  each  other  's  eye  in  silent  agreement  that  he  had n't  told  them  that  Angela  was  refusing  point-black  to  be  married  from  home  and  was  insisting  on  the  full  London  set-out reception  at  the  House  of  Commons replying  unanswerably  when  he  had  objected  on  grounds  of  expense  that  she  could  well  afford  to  pay  for  it  herself\n",
      "A  row  of  epic  proportions  had  ensued which  he  and  Angela  had  evidently  enjoyed  but  which  had  left  Sarah  and  Jennifer  sick  with  distress\n",
      "I  do n't  want  to  go  out Frank\n",
      "Someone  might  ring\n",
      "Sarah  Morgan  was  sounding  diffident  but  resolute and  as  Morgan  opened  his  mouth  to  protest  in  exasperation  the  doorbell  rang\n",
      "Both  women  looked  at  him  in  joint  appeal  and  he  marched  to  the  door pulling  it  open  with  unnecessary  force\n",
      "He  stood door  in  hand checked  by  something  in  the  way  his  visitors a  man  and  a  woman were  standing\n",
      "The  man a  stocky greying  fifty-year-old  in  a  navy  raincoat  over  a  suit his  hair  cut  short was  attended  by  a  uniformed  policewoman hair  smartly  set  under  the  cap her  eyes  watchful  in  the  wide flat placid  face and  both  of  them  were  standing  square  and  stolid\n",
      "Francis  Morgan  stood  and  stared  at  them and  even  before  the  man  stepped  forward  steadily hand  extended mouth  opening  to  speak he  understood  who  they  were  and  what  they  had  come  to  tell  him\n",
      "Catherine\n",
      "John  McLeish looking  even  bigger  than  usual appeared  in  her  office\n",
      "The  Cambridgeshire  police  think  they  have  found  Angela  Morgan\n",
      "They 've  got  a  body  of  about  the  right  description  and  they 've  gone  to  see  Miss  Morgan 's  parents\n",
      "We  need  to  hurry  but  it 'll  take  an  hour  or  so  and  I  do n't  want  the  papers  on  to  it  before  the  next  of  kin  know\n",
      "You  got  your  kit\n",
      "Catherine  Crane  wordlessly  pointed  to  the  back  of  the  door  of  her  office  on  which  hung  a  neat  suit\n",
      "He  looked  round and  realized  she  had  cleaned  the  whole  office  in  the  hour  and  a  half  since  he  had  seen  her\n",
      "Looks  a  lot  better\n",
      "And  only  just  in  time\n",
      "Meet  you  in  ten  minutes\n",
      "I 've  got  to  change then  we 're  on  our  way\n",
      "Sorry  about  lunch we 'll  get  a  sandwich\n",
      "I 'm  sorry Mr  Morgan but  we  ca n't  move  the  body  yet\n",
      "There  is  a  senior  officer  from  Scotland  Yard  on  his  way and  our  people photographers  and  so  on\n",
      "If  it 's  my  daughter  I  want  to  see  her  now I  do n't  want  to  wait\n",
      "I 'm  sorry sir\n",
      "Francis  Morgan  subsided  abruptly  on  one  of  the  uncomfortable  chesterfields  in  the  sunny cramped living-room  and  Detective  Inspector  Teversham  shifted  uncomfortably wishing  the  phone  call  would  come\n",
      "The  phone  rang\n",
      "He  sprang  to  it and  collected  instructions  in  a  room  silent  except  for  the  sound  of  Mrs  Morgan  weeping  drearily  into  her  handkerchief\n",
      "With  one  part  of  his  mind  he  logged  the  fact  that  Mum  had  understood  the  worst  immediately  and  must  in  some  way  have  been  expecting  it\n",
      "The  deceased  had  been  Daddy 's  girl then  although  it  was  usually  the  dads where  a  daughter  was  in  question who  fought  against  the  realization  of  the  truth\n",
      "His  WPC  was   looking  at  him  anxiously  for  guidance but  he  shook  his  head  at  her  slightly  and  waited standing  squarely  on  both  feet  as  he  had  done  in  many  trying  circumstances  before\n",
      "I 'll  come  with  you\n",
      "Sarah  and  Jennifer you  stay  here\n",
      "Mrs  Morgan  made  a  movement  of  protest  but  Francis  Morgan  looked  to  Teversham  for  support\n",
      "I  think  that  would  be  better yes sir he  agreed\n",
      "I  must  see  her\n",
      "Sarah  Morgan  emerged  from  her  handkerchief\n",
      "Do n't  be  silly  Sarah it  might  not  be  Angela Francis  Morgan  said desperately\n",
      "Sergeant  Jennings  here  will  make  some  tea then  she 'll  stay  with  you  while  Mr  Morgan  and  I  go  over  to  the  stables\n",
      "We 'll  be  back  inside  the  hour\n",
      "Perhaps  we  could  have  a  cup  now\n",
      "He  watched stolidly as  Mrs  Morgan  disappeared  to  the  kitchen  to  show  the  sergeant  what  was  what  and  considered without  watching  her the  other  Miss  Morgan\n",
      "She  was n't  crying  her  eyes  out\n",
      "She  was  pale but  not  as  shocked  as  she  might  have  been\n",
      "Well that  was  all  right she  could  look  after  Mum  in  the  hour  that  was  to  follow  while  the  identity  of  the  body  was  established and  in  all  the  grim  hours  after  that if  the  body  was  her  sister\n",
      "He  gently  insisted  that  Francis  Morgan  got  a  cup  of  tea with  sugar down  him  before  he  escorted  him  out  to  the  waiting  car\n",
      "He  sat  in  the  back  with  him for  company and  chatted  soothingly  of  nothing  as  the  driver  did  the  eight  miles  or  so  to  Kirton and  swept  into  the  riding-school  yard\n",
      "Evidently  a  class  had  just  finished  and  the  place  was  boiling  with  ponies small  children pink-faced  with  exertion  in  oversized  helmets  covered  with  bright  silks parents  urging  them  to  hurry  up  and  get  in  cars and  teenage  girls  bulging  out  of  light  jodhpurs  organizing  the  whole\n",
      "A  still  point  in  this  maelstrom  was  Sergeant  Black who  had  tucked  himself  between  two  of  the  sheltering  twelve-foot  evergreens  planted  to  cut  off  the  east  wind  from  the  ring\n",
      "The  man  moved  efficiently  past  a  child  who  had  succeeded  in  entangling  her  pony 's  reins  with  her  feet  and  who  was  being  blasted  for  it  by  a  girl  who  could n't  have  been  more  than  sixteen but  was  sounding  like  a  woman  three  times  her  age\n",
      "Precisely  who  it  was  she  was  using  for   a  role  model  became  clear  as  a  middle-aged  lady admirably  slim  in  well-cut  jodhpurs erupted  from  some  inner  fortress  to  enquire in  tones  that  carried  effortlessly  across  the  yard precisely  why  Caroline  had  failed  to  run  up  her  stirrups how  long  had  she  been  riding\n",
      "The  tone  was  uncompromising  but  somehow  neutral and  the  child  addressed  hastened  to  make  the  adjustment rebuked  but  not  embarrassed  or  crushed\n",
      "Teversham  stopped  where  he  was saw  Miss  Williams  notice  him and  waited  patiently  while  she  dispatched  four  of  the  assorted  teenagers  to  a  distant  meadow  with  eight  ponies and  while  the  yard  cleared  of  small  children  and  their  parents\n",
      "Miss  Williams\n",
      "Detective  Inspector  Teversham\n",
      "Mr  Morgan  is  in  my  car  over  there\n",
      "I 'll  just  have  a  word  with  him Chief  Inspector\n",
      "I  used  to  know  him  well\n",
      "She  was  white-faced  but  determined  and  the  policemen  stood  back  as  she  walked  over  towards  the  car\n",
      "Decent  of  her Teversham  observed without  moving  his  lips\n",
      "Hang  on  a  minute who 's  this\n",
      "A  grey  car immaculately  clean was  just  pulling  up  at  the  gate  and  a  big  man  in  a  plain  grey  suit  was  getting  out  to  open  it\n",
      "Must  be  the  Yard his  sergeant  observed\n",
      "The  bloke  might  be\n",
      "But  who  is  the  popsy  with  him\n",
      "Teversham 's  terms  for  pretty  women  had  been  taken  wholesale  from  his  father  who  had  been  a  young  airman  in  World  War  II\n",
      "The  car  drew  up  alongside  them McLeish  having  known  them  as  policemen  by  the  same  process  as  they  had  recognized  him\n",
      "Chief  Inspector  John  McLeish\n",
      "He  flapped  his  warrant  card  in  automatic  greeting  and  waved  a  hand  at  Catherine  who  had  also  got  out  of  the  car\n",
      "Detective  Sergeant  Crane\n",
      "He  watched  amused  as  both  the  Cambridge  detectives  shook  hands  gingerly obviously  taken  aback\n",
      "Father  of  the  missing  girl  over  there talking  to  the  good  lady  who  runs  this  establishment  and  who  has  already  seen  the  body\n",
      "There 's  a  man  of  mine  on  the  spot\n",
      "We   think  it 's  probably  your  girl  the  ring  on  the  finger  fits  the  description  and  her  parents  are  local\n",
      "John  McLeish  considered  this  admirably  succinct  report  and  decided  the  competent  bloke  was  bound  to  resent  Scotland  Yard  intrusion\n",
      "If  this  turns  out  to  be  the  lady  we 're  looking  for she  was  engaged  to  a  Treasury  Minister who  called  in  my  guv'nor\n",
      "Oh rather  you  than  me if  that 's  who  she  is\n",
      "And  much  better  you  have  it  from  the  start\n",
      "My  Super 's  already  got  his  knickers  in  a  twist\n",
      "The  reply  was  prompt  and  ungrudging  and  McLeish  breathed  easier\n",
      "It  was  no  fun  at  all  working  with  an  uncooperative  and  resentful  local  force\n",
      "I 've  got  a  scene-of-crime  squad  coming if  that 's  all  right\n",
      "I 've  worked  with  them  before you  see he  added in  explanation  and  Teversham  had  just  time  to  assure  him  he  well  understood  and  would n't  himself  like  to  work  with  anyone  else 's  squad before  Miss  Williams tears  in  her  eyes and  Francis  Morgan white  with  distress bore  down  on  them\n",
      "John  McLeish  introduced  himself  and  Catherine  in  suitably  subdued  tones\n",
      "Even  through  his  distress Francis  Morgan  was  obviously  struck  by  Catherine  Crane 's  looks  and  as  the  party  distributed  itself  into  the  big  Land  Rover  he  managed  to  sit  next  to  her\n",
      "McLeish sitting  on  the  other  side  of  her huddled  on  the  uncomfortable  bench-seating could  smell  the  faint  perfume  she  wore  and  thought with  what  detachment  he  could  bring  to  bear that  one  of  the  minor  complications  of  this  case  was  going  to  be  the  reactions  of  every  man  involved  as  suspect colleague  or  witness to  this  beauty  he  had  managed  to  import  on  to  his  staff\n",
      "The  Land  Rover  bumped  along  the  track  to  where  the  young  detective  constable looking  chilled  and  ti  red was  waiting  for  them\n",
      "As  they  decanted  themselves  McLeish  managed  to  agree  quickly  with  Teversham  that assuming  the  identification  was  confirmed he  would  take  Francis  Morgan  and  Miss  Williams  back leaving  Catherine  and  himself  at  the  site\n",
      "He  waited  tactfully  with  Catherine  and   the  young  constable  on  the  embankment liking  the  sweep  of  the  country  as  it  spread  out  in  the  raw cold  day\n",
      "Must  be  the  only  hill  between  here  and  Russia he  observed  to  Catherine  who  pointed  out  it  was n't  much  of  a  hill more  a  fifty-foot  ridge it  just  looked  high  in  this  dead  flat  plain\n",
      "You  must  know  Cambridge though John\n",
      "Your  girlfriend  studied  here did n't  she\n",
      "I  did n't  know  her  then he  said repressively uneasily  conscious  that  he  had  given  Francesca  no  thought  at  all  that  day  and  did n't  much  want  to  think  about  her  now\n",
      "Catherine  Crane  fell  silent and  he  fished  out  the  one-page  note  Teversham  had  handed  him  and  read  it scowling\n",
      "Good  God he  said involuntarily and  Catherine  looked  at  him  enquiringly\n",
      "I  know  the  boy  who  found  the  body  I  mean  it  must  be  him\n",
      "He  lives  round  here\n",
      "Jamie  Brett-Smith\n",
      "He 's  a  child  star  a  singer\n",
      "Did  the  theme  song  for  that  TV  thing\n",
      "It 's  a  hymn  tune\n",
      "My  Mum  has  it  I  do n't  think  she 's  ever  bought  a  cassette  before\n",
      "How  do  you  know  him\n",
      "McLeish  hesitated then  said  stiffly  that  he  was  Francesca 's  godson and  also  something  like  her  third  cousin or  his  mother  was\n",
      "He  glanced  down  the  slope  and  realized  the  party  was  returning\n",
      "Francis  Morgan  white-faced  and  dazed Miss  Williams  supporting  his  elbow equally  white  and  trying  not  to  cry\n",
      "Teversham at  Morgan 's  other  side nodded  to  McLeish  in  confirmation pro  forma\n",
      "The  small  group  struggled  up  the  last  piece  of  the  embankment Teversham  necessarily  in  the  rear  and  Francis  Morgan  stumbled  almost  on  to  McLeish 's  feet\n",
      "McLeish  reached  out  to  steady  him  and  the  man  looked  up  at  him unseeingly\n",
      "Christ\n",
      "Thirty  years and  it 's  all  gone\n",
      "That 's  my  Angie\n",
      "It 's  her  ring  and  I  bought  her  that  scarf\n",
      "I 'm  very  sorry\n",
      "Francis  Morgan  looked  at  him  wildly  as  Teversham  came  up  at  his  elbow solid  as  a  rock\n",
      "It 's  your  job  now is  it he  asked earnestly\n",
      "You 'll  catch  the  bastard  who  did  it\n",
      "We 'll  try sir\n",
      "Francis  Morgan  looked  from  him  to  Catherine  Crane obviously  hardly  knowing  what  he  was  doing in  an  agony  of  loss\n",
      "How  old  are  you Sergeant he  asked abruptly\n",
      "Twenty-seven sir\n",
      "Almost  the  same  age  as  her  Angie I  mean\n",
      "The  bright  brown  eyes  rested  on  her  and  you  could  see  written  all  over  his  face  the  jealousy  that  this  girl daughter  to  some  man was  still  alive  while  his  child  was  gone\n",
      "Teversham  and  his  sergeant  closed  round  Morgan shepherding  him  to  the  waiting  Land  Rover  with  meaningless  gentle  instructions  to  watch  the  step up  you  go  now\n",
      "McLeish  glanced  up  the  track  to  see in  the  distance another  Land  Rover  swaying  over  the  rough  bits and  touched  Teversham 's  elbow\n",
      "That 's  my  lot I  think\n",
      "Teversham  nodded  in  acknowledgement\n",
      "Miss  Williams we 'll  find  the  road  again  if  we  go  straight  and  turn  left  by  the  hedge wo n't  we\n",
      "Do n't  do  that McLeish  said  urgently\n",
      "Sorry but  if  there  was  a  vehicle  involved  it  probably  came  from  there\n",
      "No  tracks  on  this  side except  ours\n",
      "Damn\n",
      "Teversham  was  unnerved  by  the  nearness  of  the  following  Land  Rover  and  irritated  with  himself  for  missing  an  elementary  point\n",
      "In  the  end  it  took  ten  minutes  to  get  the  Cambridgeshire  police  Land  Rover  turned  past  McLeish 's  squad  and  their  vans and  away  back  up  to  the  stable\n",
      "Teversham  had  agreed  to  call  the  AC  at  the  yard  and  report  that  the  identification  had  been  confirmed so  that  he  could  go  and  see  Giles  Hawick\n",
      "Francis  Morgan  would  no  doubt  ring  him  too but  he  was  naturally  so  shaken  that  McLeish  thought  that  small  piece  of  insurance  worthwhile\n",
      "He  watched  them  out  of  sight then  turned  to  his  squad\n",
      "Right down  we  go\n",
      "The  corpse  is  at  the  bottom  of  the  slope\n",
      "Young  woman aged  twenty-nine dead  about  a  week  the  local  bloke  reckons\n",
      "He  glanced  down  the  slope  wishing  he  had  brought  boots his  shoes  were  already  letting  in  mud\n",
      "He  looked  at  Catherine  Crane 's  feet  and  saw  she  was  in  a  similar  situation\n",
      "The  sergeant  from  the  scene  of  crime  squad  pushed  past  him and  advanced  on  Catherine  Crane holding  out  a  pair  of  battered  wellingtons  with  the  air  of  the  prince  hopefully  extending  a  glass   slipper\n",
      "They 'll  be  too  big Sergeant but  maybe  better  than  your  shoes\n",
      "We  have  some  spare  socks too\n",
      "McLeish  watched  her  melting  smile as  did  every  man  in  the  group\n",
      "Got  anything  there  to  fit  me he  asked  pointedly and  a  young  constable  reluctantly  transferred  his  attention\n",
      "Kitted  up  some  five  minutes  later  with  a  pair  a  good  size  too  small  and  with  a  hole  in  the  right  toe McLeish  led  his  troops  into  action\n",
      "The  smell  hit  them  as  they  slithered  to  the  bottom  of  the  slope  and  McLeish  resolutely  took  a  breath  before  walking  over  to  where  the  swollen  body  lay\n",
      "It  was as  usual not  the  person  who  lay  dead  but  the  shell  in  which  the  person  had  lived\n",
      "The  girl  that  was  Angela  Morgan  had  looked  out  of  the  photograph whereas  what  lay  on  the  ground arms  outstretched could  have  been  any  young  woman  with  dark  hair\n",
      "The  well-defined  features  of  the  photograph  had  vanished the  face  had  swollen  in  death  as  had  the  exposed  arms\n",
      "Thank  God  it  was n't  high  summer McLeish  thought stepping  back  almost  on  to  Catherine 's  toes  and  reaching  for  his  handkerchief the  cold particularly  at  night would  have  retarded  decay\n",
      "The  girl  had  been  missing  for  what  a  week and  off-hand  he  agreed  with  the  local  man 's  judgement  that  she  had  been  here  for  most  of  it\n",
      "The  sapling  trees  had  grown  tall  in  the  twenty-five  years  since  the  Beeching  axe  had  fallen  on  the  single  railway  track and even  leafless  as  they  were they  effectively  screened  the  view  from  the  top\n",
      "A  thick  hedge  shielded  her  from  the  field  which  swept  down  towards  the  foot  of  the  embankment\n",
      "Whoever  had  brought  her  here  must  have  known  the  place you  could n't  have  picked  it  out  in  a  hurry\n",
      "The  country  is  not  as  deserted  as  all  that as  McLeish brought  up  in  a  village  in  Leicestershire well  knew\n",
      "There  are  always  people  about in  tractors walking  or  riding there  is  always  an  inquisitive  dog\n",
      "He  stopped  at  this  thought wondering  if  dogs  came  along  here  frequently\n",
      "Careful  round  the  body he  said  unnecessarily  to  the  sergeant  in  charge  of  the  squad who  was  matter-of-factly   distributing  heavy-duty  surgical  masks\n",
      "He  looked  round  for  Catherine  and  found  she  had  vanished\n",
      "Back  that  way sir one  of  the  squad  volunteered barely  intelligible  through  his  mask and  McLeish  saw  her twenty  yards  away walking  back  slowly  towards  them head  bowed\n",
      "All  right he  asked  as  she  came  up  beside  him  and  she  replied  that  she  was thank  you\n",
      "She  was  very  white the  freckles  standing  out  brown  on  her  skin and  she  was  blowing  her  nose\n",
      "We 'll  go  up  and  see  if  we  can  see  how  she  got  here\n",
      "Carry  on Sergeant\n",
      "He  plunged  up  the  embankment taking  a  grateful  breath  of  fresh  air then  turned  and  extended  a  large  imperative  hand  to  Catherine  Crane  and  pulled  her  up  beside  him\n",
      "Were  you  sick\n",
      "Yes sorry\n",
      "Come  on let's  get  you  up  top\n",
      "She  stood  on  the  embankment  breathing  in  gulps  of  air  as  he  stood  awkwardly  by  her then  fumbled  for  a  handkerchief  and  he  saw  that  she  was  crying\n",
      "Sorry she  said feeling  him  watching  her  and  he  fought  back  a  violent  physical  impulse  to  give  her  a  cuddle  and  take  her  away  from  all  this\n",
      "Happens he  said  gruffly patting  her  gingerly  on  the  shoulder and  striding  down  the  track  ahead  of  her\n",
      "Behind  them  he  saw  a  pair  of  horses obviously  having  been  warned  off turning  to  ride  through  a  field the  colours  of  the  riders '  helmets  very  bright  against  the  pale cold February  sky\n",
      "He  tried  to  remember  what  the  weather  had  been  like  in  the  last  week  and  realized  he  had  no  idea like  many  city-dwellers  he  had  moved  from  flat  to  car  to  office  without  registering  any  variation\n",
      "It 's  obviously  rained  a  lot Catherine  Crane  volunteered edging  cautiously  down  the  side  of  the  track\n",
      "That 's  a  tractor is n't  it\n",
      "I  suppose  they  could  have  come  that  way\n",
      "McLeish  was  walking  the  track also  keeping  well  to  one  edge watching  carefully\n",
      "Still  the  same  tractor\n",
      "Hang  on here 's  car  tracks\n",
      "Faint but  there\n",
      "McLeish  squatted  unselfconsciously  in  the  mud\n",
      "No  point  me  being  clever\n",
      "He  walked  back  along  the  side  of  the  track  and  edged   down  to  join  the  scene-of-crime  squad\n",
      "I  want  the  whole  track  photographed  and  samples  taken\n",
      "Some  car  tracks lots  of  tractor  tracks very  deep\n",
      "Sticky  stuff this  clay\n",
      "Likely  any  car  would  have  traces  of  it  for  a  long  time\n",
      "Dyes  clothes  yellow too the  sergeant  in  charge  volunteered\n",
      "Is  it  murder then sir\n",
      "Well have  you  noticed  the  head\n",
      "It 's  out  of  shape\n",
      "She 's  been  missing  for  a  week was  going  to  marry  a  rising  Minister successful  career everything  coming  up  roses\n",
      "Does n't  look  like  an  accident\n",
      "I 'll  get  the  doc  to  think  on when  he  arrives\n",
      "That 's  the  Land  Rover  back  now\n",
      "I  can  hear  it\n",
      "Likely  that 'll  be  him\n",
      "It  was  and  McLeish  greeted  him  with  relief\n",
      "This  was  a  senior  man  whom  he  had  worked  with  before a  fellow  Scot grey-haired  now slight quick-moving  and  thorough\n",
      "He  went  back  down  the  embankment  with  him telling  Catherine  to  stay  where  she  was  and  help  with  photographing  the  track\n",
      "Dr  Scott from  long  experience did  no  more  than  wrinkle  his  nose  at  the  odour  of  decay and  spent  twenty  minutes  there mostly  occupied  with  a  careful  consideration  of  the  head\n",
      "How  long  do  you  think  she 's  been  dead\n",
      "Rigor  completely  gone\n",
      "Scott  lifted  gently  one  bloodless  arm which  fell  limply\n",
      "Subcutaneous  swelling decay\n",
      "Six  or  seven  days I  would  say  I 'll  not  be  able  to  be  more  precise  until  the  autopsy\n",
      "What  was  it Doc\n",
      "Very  nasty  bang  on  the  head  for  one  thing\n",
      "You  noticed  the  skull  is  bulging  there look\n",
      "Done  with  something  sharp-edged and  a  lot  of  force\n",
      "That  killed  her\n",
      "John  McLeish  asked\n",
      "Probably\n",
      "I 'll  start  as  soon  as  you  can  get  the  body  back\n",
      "I 'll  ring  you  tomorrow  or  later  tonight\n",
      "McLeish  thanked  him scrambled  up  the  embankment drawing  in  deep  breaths and  walked  carefully  down  the  side  of  the  track  in  the  sizeable  footsteps  of  his  squad explaining  to  them  that  they  were  looking  for  a  sharp-edged  weapon\n",
      "He  found  Catherine  Crane  competently  and  tactfully  assisting  with  operations and  as  he  came  to   stand  beside  her  realized  she  was  so  cold  that  she  was  almost  shuddering\n",
      "He  bustled  her  back  to  the  Land  Rover  and  raided  the  squad 's  provision  box  which  he  knew  from  experience  would  contain  thick  sandwiches  and  hot  nourishing  drinks\n",
      "He  pressed  both  on  her\n",
      "I 'm  sorry she  said when  the  shuddering  had  become  only  a  shiver\n",
      "I  did n't  realize  I 'd  got  so  cold\n",
      "Well you  lost  your  breakfast  and  you  never  got  lunch\n",
      "We 'll  get  a  square  meal then  we 'll  see  the  family\n",
      "I  do n't  want  to  spend  too  long  there 's  a  lot  else  to  do  in  London  and  I 'd  rather  have  the  autopsy  before  I  ask  too  many  questions\n",
      "Come  on we 'll  walk  back  to  the  car\n",
      "Even  in  the  twenty  minutes  it  had  taken  to  get  some  nourishment the  light  had  faded  and  the  dull  day  was  darkening  into  a  cold  night the  beginnings  of  a  frost  crackled  under  their  feet  as  they  walked  briskly  along  the  embankment\n",
      "The  long  ridge  to  their  left  looked  particularly  bleak  and  lifeless the  heavy  clay  sitting  solidly  in  the  ridges  where  the  plough  had  left  it  months  before no  trace  of  last  year 's  crop nothing  to  indicate  that  this  was  good  cereal  country\n",
      "The  tops  of  the  sapling  trees waist-high  at  the  edge  of  the  embankment were  leafless  and  still\n",
      "A  bad cold  night  to  lie  out  in\n",
      "McLeish  had  to  remind  himself  that  the  dead  girl  behind  them  would  have  felt  none  of  this  dank  chill\n",
      "It  was  almost  totally  dark  when  they  arrived  in  the  stable  yard  and  Catherine  jumped  involuntarily  as  something  moved  and  rattled  against  the  boards\n",
      "The  hunters  will  be  in  only  the  rough  ponies  will  be  turned  out McLeish  observed  out  of  childhood  knowledge  as  he  led  her  towards  his  car looking  very  forlorn  in  the  big  parking  area\n",
      "As  he  unlocked  it a  light  came  on  almost  above  his  head\n",
      "Who  is  it\n",
      "It  was  a  clear carrying  command  with  no  anxiety  in  it  at  all and  McLeish  identified  himself  promptly\n",
      "Ah\n",
      "Will  you  come  in  for  a  cup  of  tea\n",
      "I  have  James  Brett-Smith who  found  Angela  this  morning\n",
      "He  says  he  knows  you  and  came  back  in  case  you  wanted  to  see  him\n",
      "McLeish  sighed  inwardly\n",
      "Of  course Miss  Williams\n",
      "Sergeant  Crane  and  I  would  be  glad  of  tea\n",
      "Hello sunshine\n",
      "This  last  was  addressed  to  Jamie who  was  peering  round  Miss  Williams  and  was  openly  pleased  to  see  him\n",
      "Not  every  day  you  saw  that  poised competent  kid  distressed McLeish  thought resting  a  hand  on  his  shoulder\n",
      "It  took  a  lot  to  faze  a  talented  one  like  that who  had  been  a  successful  soloist  for  two  years managing  with  having  a  sick  father  and  about  one  tenth  of  his  mother 's  attention\n",
      "He  realized  the  boy  had  grown  in  the  two  months  since  he  had  last  seen  him  and  looked  at  him  carefully noticing  the  way  his  wrists  poked  out  of  the  shirt  and  the  slight  roughness  of  the  clear  skin\n",
      "Is  Francesca  still  in  New  York the  brat  was  asking  anxiously and  McLeish who  had  not  wanted  to  discuss  her  in  this  company found  he  had  to  reassure  Jamie  about  her  whereabouts  and  probable  date  of  return\n",
      "She 's  chaperoning  for  me  on  Monday  next  week the  boy  explained\n",
      "I 'd  forgotten but  she  wo n't  have\n",
      "Come  and  tell  me  about  this  morning He  looked  round  for  Catherine  to  discover  that  with  admirable  good  sense  she  had  asked  for  the  facilities  of  the  house and  was  being  issued  with  soap  and  hand-towels  by  Miss  Williams\n",
      "He  took  Jamie  quickly  through  his  story finding  him  healthily  excited  by  his  part  in  it but  with  an  obvious  undercurrent  of  anxiety\n",
      "John Jamie  asked  when  he  had  told  his  story you  wo n't  leave  her  there will  you\n",
      "No no Jamie that 's  the  ambulance  I  can  hear  now come  to  pick  her  up\n",
      "The  boy 's  colour  came  back  and  he  looked  shame-faced  at  McLeish\n",
      "I  know  it 's  silly I  mean  she 's  dead but  it 's  so  cold  and  I  could n't  bear  the  idea  of  her  just  lying  there\n",
      "Curious  how  the  same  thought  had  struck  him McLeish  reflected as  he  looked  properly  round  the  warm untidy  comfort  of  Miss  Williams  s  sitting-room which  smelled  cheerfully  of  woodsmoke  and  wet  dog\n",
      "A  big  black  Labrador catching  his  eye thumped  her  tail  and  rolled  on  her  side looking  up  at  him  hopefully\n",
      "She  closed  her  eyes  in  ecstasy  as  Jamie  flung  himself  on  her accusing  her  of  being  a  flirt\n",
      "McLeish  looked  past  the  boy  to  see  Catherine  Crane colour  returned seated  on  an  upright  chair drinking  tea\n",
      "He  grinned  at  her\n",
      "We 'd  best  get  on Miss  Williams but  could  I  use  a  cloakroom  too\n",
      "Is  Jamie  being  collected or  does  he  want  a  ride  home\n",
      "No no his  aunt  is  coming  for  him\n",
      "He 's  just  polishing  some  tack  for  me\n",
      "So  he  was McLeish  observed the  devil  plainly  being  given  no  opportunity  to  find  work  for  idle  hands\n",
      "He  extracted  Catherine  a  short  while  later  and  turned  the  car  back  on  the  darkened  road  which  would  lead  them  towards  the  A1\n",
      "There  were  three  dog  leads  and  a  packet  of  dog  biscuits  in  the  cloakroom he  told  her grinning  in  the  darkness\n",
      "The  hairbrush  in  Miss  Williams 's  bathroom  had  Labrador  hairs  in  it\n",
      "Or  it  was  the  Labrador 's  hairbrush Catherine  Crane  offered  demurely and  McLeish  burst  out  laughing glancing  admiringly  sideways  at  her\n",
      "He  felt  extremely  comfortable  with  her  already he  thought  happily\n",
      "They  followed  Miss  Williams 's  directions  to  the  Morgan  family and  knocked  on  the  door being  let  in  promptly  by  the  stocky  WPC  who  had  stayed  in  the  house  with  the  women  of  the  Morgan  family\n",
      "Jennifer  Morgan  came  into  the  hall she  had  been  crying  and  was  looking  white but  had  herself  in  hand\n",
      "Dad  is  lying  down\n",
      "He  wanted  to  be  called  when  you  arrived\n",
      "I  do n't  know  if  you  would  like  to  talk  to  Mum  and  me  first\n",
      "I 'm  sorry  to  trouble  you  now but  if  you  can  bear  it  it  would  help  us  to  get  some  more  information  from  you  all\n",
      "I  had  spoken  to  your  father  before  on  the  telephone when  your  sister  was  first  reported  missing but  we  did n't  cover  all  that  much  ground\n",
      "Oh I 'd  rather  talk  about  it  now Jennifer  Morgan  said  drearily\n",
      "You 've  talked  to  Giles of  course\n",
      "When  he  reported  your  sister  missing  McLeish  confirmed leaping  at  the  opening\n",
      "I  understand  that  you  have  known  him  longest  of  all  the  family\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Do  you  know  him  well\n",
      "She  gave  him  a  level  look understanding  that  he  must  be  working as  they  say on  information  received\n",
      "Quick as  her  dead  sister  must  have  been\n",
      "We  did  go  out  together  a  few  times yes Chief  Inspector\n",
      "I  liked  him but  he  and  Angela  are  were  better  suited  to  each  other\n",
      "It  must  have  been  painful  to  have  a  man  you  liked  appropriated  by  a  younger  sister McLeish  thought but  this  self-contained  creature  was  not  going  to  tell  him  or  possibly  anyone  else  how  it  had  felt\n",
      "He  considered  her as  he  went  through  the  routine  questions  about  when  she  had  last  seen  her  sister\n",
      "We  did n't  meet  very  often  in  London  unless  it  was  a  party\n",
      "I  work  in  the  British  Museum and  my  flat  is  quite  close  to  it\n",
      "I  m  an  Assistant  Curator  in  the  Middle  Eastern  section\n",
      "McLeish  blinked  involuntarily and  she  smiled  faintly\n",
      "I  read  Middle  Eastern  Languages and  spent  a  year  in  Turkey  after  Oxford then  came  back  to  the  Museum\n",
      "I  specialize  in  fourteenth-century  ceramics\n",
      "It  was  a  less  lively  face  than  her  sister 's  because  it  was  more  turned  in more  contemplative less  concerned  with  the  things  of  this  world\n",
      "Well fourteenth-century  Turkey  must  be  pretty  safely  removed  from  the  things  of  this  world\n",
      "He  considered  her  good  but  unremarkable  clothes and  wondered  what  she  did  for  laughs\n",
      "Or  was  fourteenth-century  Turkey  laughs  enough what  did  he  know\n",
      "He  fell  back  on  routine  and  asked  Jennifer  to  confirm  exactly  when  she  had  last  seen  Angela\n",
      "I  last  saw  her  here the  weekend  before  she  disappeared\n",
      "She  came  up  here  for  a  night  to  see  Mummy to  sort  out  some  details  about  the  wedding\n",
      "That  must  be  a  lot  of  work  for  your  mother McLeish  said hopefully and  got  another  level distantly  amused  look\n",
      "You  would  have  to  ask  her  that\n",
      "My  impression  was  that  since  it  was  to  be  held  in  London Angela  was  doing  the  work with  a  good  deal  of  help  from  colleagues  at  Yeo  Davis\n",
      "They  have  a  lot  of  experience  of  large  parties\n",
      "Ouch McLeish  thought not  such  a  gentle distant  academic are  you\n",
      "A  very  sardonic  eye  there  indeed\n",
      "We  talked  to  Mr  Yeo  when  your  sister  was  reported  missing\n",
      "He  obviously  considered  your  sister  a  very  valuable  colleague\n",
      "She  is  was  extremely  competent as  well  as  very  good  at  getting  on  with  people which  is  of  course  critical  to  jobs  like  that\n",
      "I  imagine  she  will  be  very  much  missed\n",
      "She  looked  sharply  out  of  the  window  and  produced  a  handkerchief  which  she  held  clenched  in  her  hand  but  did  not  use\n",
      "Miss  Morgan would  you  like  to  stop  for  a  minute\n",
      "Can  we  get  you  some  more  coffee\n",
      "McLeish  glanced  at  Catherine  who  was  already  on  her  feet and  Jennifer  Morgan  nodded  in  acquiescence\n",
      "I 'm  sorry\n",
      "I 'll  just  go  and  tidy  up\n",
      "She  got  up  stiffly  and  went  upstairs holding  blindly  on  to  the  banisters\n",
      "McLeish  joined  Catherine  in  the  comfortable  modern  kitchen  where  they  foraged  companionably  for  coffee  and  milk waiting  until  they  heard  Jennifer  Morgan  come  down  again\n",
      "I 'm  sorry she  said wearily\n",
      "Where  were  we\n",
      "My  mother  is  coming  in  a  minute\n",
      "We  were  asking  about  your  sister 's  position  at  Yeo  Davis\n",
      "I  think  you  had  made  it  clear  that  Mr  Yeo  very  much  valued  her\n",
      "Would  she  have  wanted  to  continue  working  there  after  she  was  married\n",
      "Jennifer  Morgan  looked  at  him  quickly  and  he  realized  he  must  have  stumbled  on  something\n",
      "But  she  knew  her  hesitation  had  given  him  a  lead\n",
      "She  would  have  wanted  to  continue yes\n",
      "There  might  have  been  some  difficulty  there  because  of  Giles  s  position because  of  the  conflict  of  interest\n",
      "Yeo  Davis  exists  to  lobby  government  and  Giles  is  a  Minister\n",
      "She  sounded  like  Francesca  when  she  talked  about  Yeo  Davis McLeish  reflected\n",
      "Did  he  want  her  to  give  it  up\n",
      "Yes he  did\n",
      "He  found  it  awkward but  Angela  was  naturally  reluctant\n",
      "Some  colour  had  come  back  into  Jennifer 's  face\n",
      "So  he  talked  to  you  about  it McLeish  thought and  saw   Catherine  register  the  same  point\n",
      "He  decided  to  leave  this  one  for  the  moment  but  logged  the  fact  that  Jennifer  Morgan  had  still  been  interested  in and  comfortable  with the  man  who  had  become  her  sister 's  fiancé\n",
      "A  tap  on  the  door  made  them  all  start\n",
      "Catherine  Crane  went  across  to  open  it  and  held  a  murmured  conversation  with  someone\n",
      "Sarah  Morgan  came  in  to  the  room  like  a  ghost and  McLeish  drew  breath  as  he  saw  her\n",
      "She  was  deathly  pale the  mid-brown  hair  flattened  to  her  head the  lined  skin  without  make-up  except  for  a  brave  but  mistaken  line  of  smudged  lipstick\n",
      "She  looked  at  him  dumbly and  even  McLeish 's  hardened  investigator 's  nerve  failed  him\n",
      "He  glanced  involuntarily  at  Jennifer  Morgan  who  said  she  would  make  tea which  was  what  her  mother  preferred and  bore  her  off  to  the  kitchen\n",
      "They  returned  with  the  tea  accompanied  by  a  bottle  of  pills  Valium McLeish  noticed  automatically  and  with  Mrs  Morgan  looking  more  gathered\n",
      "The  buttons  of  her  cardigan  were  correctly  done  up  and  the  collar  flattened  neatly the  zip  of  the  skirt  was  in  its  proper  place  at  the  side  and  her  tattered  bedroom  slippers  had  been  replaced  with  a  tidy  pair  of  court  shoes the  wrong  colour  for  the  skirt\n",
      "It  was  better but  not  a  lot and  McLeish  who  knew  her  to  be  in  her  late  fifties  decided  any  casual  observer  would  put  her  at  nearer  seventy\n",
      "Jennifer  Morgan  looked  at  him  doubtfully but  he  shook  his  head  to  her  implied  question he  preferred  to  conduct  his  interviews  without  members  of  the  family  present\n",
      "Wo n't  be  long he  said reassuringly just  managing  not  to  pat  Jennifer  Morgan  on  her  beige  cashmere  shoulder\n",
      "He  was  extremely  gentle  with  Sarah  Morgan as  he  had  implicitly  promised  her  daughter but  it  was  a  desperately  painful  experience and he  began  to  fear not  a  useful  one\n",
      "She  had  not  seen  Angela  since  the  weekend  before  the  one  on  which  she  had  disappeared but  had  spoken  to  her  twice  on  the  telephone\n",
      "Well  yes Angie  had  been  very  busy  and  preoccupied  with  the  wedding  preparations naturally but  she  had  been  happy\n",
      "And  no they  had  not  been  expecting  to  see  her  that  weekend though  with  Giles   away  she  had  said  she  might  come  on  the  Sunday\n",
      "But  she  would  have  telephoned  first\n",
      "She  seemed  to  be  eased  by  talking  of  her  daughter and  by  the  time  she  stopped apologetically and  drank  some  tea  poured  for  her  by  Catherine she  looked  exhausted  but  less  like  a  wraith\n",
      "She  pushed  the  Valium  aside observing  that  she  did  prefer  not  to  take  drugs a  reaction  so  typical  of  her  age  and  class  that  McLeish  decided  he  might  after  all  be  able  to  conduct  a  useful  interview\n",
      "I  understand  it  was  your  older  daughter  who  met  Mr  Hawick  first\n",
      "Yes she  did and  I  think  she  hoped  something  would  come  of  it  well so  did  I.  But  when  he  met  Angela  he  was  just  bowled  over  by  her\n",
      "I  was  sorry  for  Jennifer  but  they  had  only  been  going  out  for  a  month  or  so and  not  terribly  seriously\n",
      "And  in  any  case you  ca n't  do  anything  about  these  attractions can  you\n",
      "McLeish  agreed  with  her  promptly  and  she  raised  half  a  smile  for  him\n",
      "He  waited remembering  Jennifer  Morgan 's  obvious  pain  and  wondering  what  her  mother 's  views  about  it  were\n",
      "He  watched  her  thoughtfully  as  she  ate  a  biscuit\n",
      "Angela  must  have  been  a  very  attractive  girl he  suggested cautiously\n",
      "Oh she  was Sarah  Morgan  agreed\n",
      "But  I  used  to  wonder  whether  she  was  ever  going  to  get  married\n",
      "She  never  seemed  to  fall  for  anyone  her  own  age they  were  always  older\n",
      "She  was  talking  with  the  ease  of  total  emotional  exhaustion\n",
      "Was  there  anyone  else  who  was  important  to  her  I  mean  before  she  met  Mr  Hawick of  course he  asked vaguely\n",
      "Mrs  Morgan  took  another  biscuit  and  accepted  another  cup  of  tea\n",
      "I  did  think  that  there  was  something  between  her  and  Peter  Yeo  her  partner  but  nothing  came  of  it\n",
      "He  has  a  wife  and  children  and  most  men  do n't  usually  leave  their  wives do  they\n",
      "The  question  was  rhetorical  and  McLeish  waited\n",
      "Anyway Giles  was  perfect  for  her fourteen  years  older  and  with  his  own  very  distinguished  career\n",
      "I  was   sure  she  was  going  to  be  happily  settled\n",
      "She  stopped staring  out  of  the  window her  hands  clenched  together\n",
      "And  then  this  terrible  thing  happens\n",
      "Who  could  have  wanted  to  kill  her\n",
      "Francis  Morgan  did  not  bother  with  knocking  at  the  door  but  walked  in  without  apology\n",
      "He  was  deathly  pale  and  obviously  still  in  the  first  shock  of  grief  but  it  had  taken  him  differently\n",
      "He  was  wound  up  like  a  spring furiously  angry unable  to  keep  still  or  to  prevent  himself  from  fidgeting\n",
      "Where 's  Sarah he  demanded and  took  in  the  scene  in  front  of  him\n",
      "Why  did n't  you  wake  me\n",
      "I  understand  the  doctor  wanted  you  to  have  a  sleep  if  you  could Mr  Morgan  Catherine  Crane  said  briskly\n",
      "Would  you  like  some  tea\n",
      "We  have  only  just  started  talking  with  Mrs  Morgan\n",
      "She  looked  very  young  and  pretty  as  she  held  up  the  teapot  and  Francis  Morgan  hesitated then  sat  down heavily and  seized  two  biscuits\n",
      "Sorry he  said awkwardly through  a  mouthful  of  Rich  Tea\n",
      "I  ca n't  stop  thinking  about  her  and  wondering  what  happened\n",
      "He  slapped  both  hands  palms  down  on  the  table slopping  his  tea  and  making  them  all  jump totally  unselfconscious  in  his  misery\n",
      "What McLeish  wondered  acerbically did  he  imagine  his  wife  and  surviving  daughter  were  thinking  about  or  did  he  assume  they  had  taken  the  death  of  a  daughter  and  a  sister  in  their  stride\n",
      "From  under  his  eyelashes  he  could  see  Mrs  Morgan  was  watching  her  husband  with  a  sort  of  furious  compassion and  was  careful  not  to  catch  her  eye\n",
      "The  man  was  quite  literally  distracted unable  to  concentrate  at  all\n",
      "McLeish  looked  thoughtfully  at  Jennifer  Morgan  who  had  come  in  and  was  considering  her  father  with  what  he  was  startled  to  recognize  as  dislike\n",
      "This  was  evidently  a  family  that  was  not  going  to  be  brought  closer  by  grief\n",
      "She  nodded  to  McLeish  and  started  gently  to  bustle  her  mother  away\n",
      "He  settled  Francis  Morgan  down  as  best  he  could  and  took  him  again  through  the  events  of  the  week  before  his  daughter  vanished\n",
      "No he  had n't  seen  her  for  a  week  before  that  weekend he  had  missed  her  this  with  a  baleful  glance  towards  the  door  and  had   indeed  got  as  far  as  ringing  her  up  on  the  Saturday  morning hoping  she  would  come  up  for  Sunday but  had  got  no  answer  from  her  flat\n",
      "It  was n't  worth  going  down  on  the  off-chance or  so  I  thought\n",
      "But  perhaps  if  I  had\n",
      "You  were  close  to  your  daughter then\n",
      "McLeish  asked  hopefully\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "We  were  like  each  other she  knew  what  she  wanted  and  she  did n't  mess  around\n",
      "I  ca n't  bear  people  who  do n't  know  what  they  want  and  dither\n",
      "So  you  were  pleased  that  she  was  marrying\n",
      "Not  particularly\n",
      "McLeish  did  not  manage  to  conceal  surprise  and  Francis  Morgan  looked  at  him  wretchedly the  restless  brown  eyes  wide-set like  the  dead  girl 's and  very  bright\n",
      "He 's  all  right I  suppose Giles  for  a  politician\n",
      "But  he  thinks  he 's  the  centre  of  the  world  and  he  was  going  to  make  it  difficult  for  Angie  to  do  what  she  wanted  if  it  would  affect  his  career\n",
      "He  likes  all  that the  cars  and  people  calling  him  Minister but  he  wanted  her  to  be  the  good  politician 's  wife doing  his  entertaining\n",
      "He  did n't  say  so mind but  I  told  Angie  she  would  have  to  watch  it  after  she  married  him\n",
      "And  he  wanted  her  money of  course\n",
      "These  chaps  do n't  have  security  of  tenure\n",
      "McLeish  reflected  that  Giles  Hawick  was  the  classic  example  of  someone  who  knew  what  they  wanted  and  did n't  mess  around and  that  that  was  what  had  attracted  Francis  Morgan 's  daughter\n",
      "Perhaps  he  had  not  said  to  himself  that  in  a  marriage  between  two  like  this someone  was  going  to  have  to  know  a  little  less  clearly  what  they  had  wanted\n",
      "Was  there  someone  else  around  you  would  rather  she  had  married he  asked  bluntly deciding  it  was  that  sort  of  conversation\n",
      "No  one  in  particular but  I  thought  she 'd  have  been  better  off  with  a  chap  of  her  own  age  who  would  have  wanted  her  to  carry  on  where  she  was\n",
      "Someone  who  would  have  known  she  was  exceptional  and  have  encouraged  her\n",
      "And  been  less  of  a  direct  rival  to  her  Dad and  all McLeish  thought and  stuck  to  his  line\n",
      "And  there  was  no  one  like  that  in  her  life\n",
      "Francis  Morgan calmer  now visibly  bent  his  mind  to  the  question\n",
      "She  had  dozens  of  boyfriends he  said wistfully\n",
      "I  probably  met  them  all\n",
      "But  they  did n't  seem  to  last  very  long\n",
      "She  did n't  want  to  settle  down you  see and  they  all  wanted  her  to\n",
      "McLeish  decided  he  was  not  going  to  get  much  more  out  of  this  and  went  on  to  check gently what  Francis  Morgan  had  done  with  the  weekend\n",
      "He  appeared  to  have  spent  it  blamelessly  playing  golf dining  with  neighbours  and  at  home  doing  some  work\n",
      "He  would  check  it if  he  needed  to but  he  could  not  at  the  moment  see  why  Morgan  would  have  wanted  to  kill  the  daughter  to  whom  he  had  plainly  been  so  devoted\n",
      "He  managed  to  have  another  few  words  with  Mrs  Morgan  also who  was  looking  much  stronger\n",
      "She  apologized  obliquely  for  her  husband and  McLeish  murmured  that  Mr  Morgan  had  obviously  been  very  much  attached  to  Angela\n",
      "So  was  I Chief  Inspector Sarah  Morgan  said  evenly\n",
      "And  I  was  glad  she  was  marrying  an  older  man  like  Giles  Hawick\n",
      "The  emphasis  on  the  I was  faint  but  definite  and  McLeish  carried  the  echo  away  in  his  head\n",
      "I  do n't  mean  to  sound  ungrateful but  I 'm  starving Catherine  said as  they  reached  the  gate\n",
      "Can  you  wait  till  London\n",
      "There 's  a  good  place  in  Ealing  well  it 's  a  chipper  really but  he  has  good  steaks  at  any  time  you  want  them\n",
      "Have  a  sleep  if  you  want\n",
      "She  slept  deeply  while  they  were  on  the  motorway but  woke  as  he  came  into  London  and  had  to  stop  and  start  in  the  heavy  evening  traffic\n",
      "Better she  said smiling  at  him\n",
      "Dinner  s  not  far\n",
      "Restored  by  a  large  steak he  explained  to  her  as  they  ate   that  he  liked  to  work  very  quickly  on  a  murder  case pushing  everyone  to  get  an  answer\n",
      "I  expect  that  means  you  do  more  cases  than  most\n",
      "I 've  been  a  bit  lucky he  said modestly\n",
      "I 've  ended  up  most  of  them  with  a  full  confession once  we 'd  worked  it  out\n",
      "That  way  you  know  you 've  got  it  right\n",
      "Unless  you 're  in  Henley she  observed  with  privileged  acerbity  and  he  laughed embarrassed  as  every  policeman  had  been  by  the  revelations  just  made  of  Thames  Valley 's  modus  operandi\n",
      "Eight  cases  withdrawn  so  far is n't  it\n",
      "Catherine  asked\n",
      "And  more  to  come\n",
      "He  smiled  at  her thinking  what  a  treat  it  was  to  talk  shop  with  someone  as  beautiful  and  intelligent  as  this\n",
      "She  insisted  quietly  on  halving  the  bill  and  he  let  her  have  her  way not  wanting  to  jeopardize  his  chance  of  eating  with  her  in  the  future\n",
      "He  glanced  up  as  they  completed  this  transaction  to  find  the  attention  of  the  nearest  two  tables both  exclusively  male fixed  disbelievingly  on  them\n",
      "As  three  men  slowly  looked  away  McLeish  received  the  uncompromising  message  that  if  any  of  them  had  been  so  lucky  as  to  have  dinner  with  Catherine  Crane none  of  them  would  have  let  her  pay  for  herself\n",
      "Indeed  he  had  a  strong  feeling  that  only  his  six  foot  four  inches  prevented  one  of  them  from  saying  so\n",
      "He  glanced  at  Catherine  but  she  had  obviously  noticed  nothing  out  of  the  way\n",
      "Outside  the  restaurant  McLeish  hesitated not  wanting  the  evening  to  end\n",
      "A  drink he  suggested hopefully but  Catherine  shook  her  head\n",
      "My  flat  is  in  almost  as  much  of  a  mess  as  the  office\n",
      "I  was  in  a  chain and  I  only  managed  to  complete  last  week\n",
      "I 'd  better  go  and  get  it  straight\n",
      "I  have n't  even  got  the  curtains  hung or  unpacked  the  kitchen  stuff\n",
      "Let  me  come  and  help\n",
      "McLeish  offered cheerfully\n",
      "It  is  the  fault  of  C1  that  you  do n't  have  today  or  tomorrow  to  get  straight\n",
      "I 'll  come  and  put  in  a  couple  of  hours so  you  can  get  a  bit  more  comfortable\n",
      "She  hesitated then  said  that  she  would  like  that  rather  than  a  drink if  he  really  would n't  mind\n",
      "The  flat  was  indeed  in  some  disarray immaculately  clean evidently  she  had  done  that  first but  with  most  of  its  furnishings  disposed  in  boxes  on  the  floor\n",
      "McLeish naturally  efficient  and  brought  up  by  a  mother  with  firm  views  on  men 's  participation  in  the  drearier  household  chores took  just  over  an  hour  to  sort  her  kitchen  to  her  satisfaction  while  she  got  the  living-room  straight with  all  the  books  unpacked\n",
      "That 's  marvellous\n",
      "Thank  you  very  much\n",
      "Can  I  give  you  a  coffee\n",
      "I 'd  like  that\n",
      "Then  I 'll  be  off  so  you  can  catch  up  with  yourself\n",
      "They  fell  comfortably  into  gossip  about  various  parts  of  their  experience  until  McLeish  noticed  she  was  looking  tired\n",
      "I 'm  off he  said briskly\n",
      "I 'll  be  going  into  the  Yard  first  thing  to  work  out  what 's  to  do\n",
      "I 'll  not  need  anyone  till  about  lunch-time  so  you  have  your  sleep  in but  I  may  ring  you  up  after  that\n",
      "I  find  if  you  get  the  case  started  off  quickly  it  all  goes  easily\n",
      "She  thanked  him  demurely and  he  realized  she  was  laughing  at  him\n",
      "He  looked  down  at  her about  to  kiss  her  good-night  as  if  she  were  one  of  Francesca 's  friends and  pulled  himself  up\n",
      "This  was  a  colleague a  fellow  detective\n",
      "As  well  take  to  kissing  Bruce  Davidson  good-night he  told  himself and  got  himself  out  of  the  door  on  this  thought\n",
      "The  telephone  was  ringing  as  McLeish  walked  into  his  own  flat and  he  picked  it  up  to  find  his  Commander  on  the  other  end  of  the  line\n",
      "So  I 've  arranged  you 'll  take  a  statement  from  Hawick  tomorrow  afternoon then\n",
      "We  have n't  got  the  autopsy sir so  I 've  no  idea  when  the  girl  died yet\n",
      "I 'll  have  to  see  him  again  when  I  do  know\n",
      "Would n't  he  rather  wait  twenty-four  hours\n",
      "He 's  a  busy  man\n",
      "Also  he  wants  to  talk  to  someone he  wants  to  make  sure  we 're  doing  our  job\n",
      "Do n't  give  me  a  hard  time McLeish just  bloody  do  it\n",
      "Sir\n",
      "Do n't  be  like  that\n",
      "Take  that  gorgeous  sergeant  of  yours give  Hawick  something  to  look  at\n",
      "She 's  been  with  me  in  Cambridge  all  day  I  told  her  she  could  have  Sunday  off\n",
      "Then  tell  her  different\n",
      "She  with  you\n",
      "No sir\n",
      "I  left  her  at  her  flat\n",
      "Your  girl 's  due  back  when\n",
      "McLeish  raised  his  eyebrows taken  aback  by  the  transparency  of  his  superior 's  line  of  thought and  primly  gave  him  Francesca 's  projected  timetable\n",
      "Glad  to  hear  it\n",
      "Good  luck  with  the  Minister and  give  me  a  ring  afterwards\n",
      "I  like  to  know  where  the  bullets  are  coming  from\n",
      "G'night\n",
      "McLeish shaking  his  head rang  Catherine  and  broke  it  to  her  apologetically  that  she  would  be  required  for  the  afternoon\n",
      "Does n't  matter\n",
      "We  you  would  have  had  to  see  him  soon  anyway\n",
      "Is  the  autopsy  going  to  give  us  much  idea  when  Angela  Morgan  died  I  mean  within  a  day  or  so\n",
      "Probably  not McLeish  conceded\n",
      "He  went  to  bed  to  dream  uneasily and  woke  early  as  he  always  did  in  the  early  stages  of  a  case  before  he  had  got  the  machine  working  properly\n",
      "At  tea-ti  me  the  next  day  he  picked  up  Catherine  at  her  flat noticing  that  she  was  looking  rested  and  pretty  even  if  he  was  feeling  jaded  and  disaffected\n",
      "They  were  received  in  the  Minister 's  private  flat  in  one  of  the  narrow  streets  close  to  the  House  of  Commons\n",
      "McLeish  remembered  that  this  man 's  constituency  was  in  Derbyshire\n",
      "They  took  a  tiny cramped  lift  to  the  top  floor  of  the  building  and  were  admitted  by  Hawick who  was  wearing  an  expensive  blue-green  sweater and  slacks the  clothes  sitting  easily  on  his  long slim  frame the  dark  hair  beautifully  cut a  little  too  long flopping  on  his  forehead\n",
      "Despite  the  elegance it  was  a  completely  masculine  presence and  he  dominated  the  room  as  easily  as  he  had  his  own  office\n",
      "He  was  grim-faced  and  looked  as  if  he  had  not  slept but  he  offered  them  freshly  made  coffee  and  raised  a  smile  for  Catherine\n",
      "He  saw  her  comfortably  established  at  a  table  I  know   you 'll  want  to  take  notes and  offered  McLeish  his  choice  of  three  big  armchairs\n",
      "I 'm  not  sure  some  of  the  upright  ones  will  hold  you Chief  Inspector I  sit  on  them  very  gingerly  myself\n",
      "Hawick  chose  a  big  chair  by  the  fireplace  in  which  a  simulated  coal  fire  burned  merrily emitting  real  warmth  thanks  to  the  gas  which  powered  it\n",
      "I 'd  prefer  a  proper  fire of  course but  we  made  them  illegal  in  this  part  of  London  some  years  ago\n",
      "We McLeish  remembered  from  Francesca did  not  necessarily  mean  this  administration  but  must  mean  one  of  the  same  political  persuasion\n",
      "Measures  passed  by  those  of  a  different  political  hue  were  described  as  the  work  of  a  previous  government\n",
      "A  good  room  to  be  in McLeish  thought with  its  high  ceiling  and  the  Sunday  quiet  of  London and  what  was  obviously  a  copy  of  every  Sunday  paper  published  lying  tidily  on  a  side  table\n",
      "It  comes  with  the  job Giles  Hawick  explained following  his  eye\n",
      "We  read  them  all\n",
      "There  is  nothing  yet  about  Angela  in  any  of  them\n",
      "No sir\n",
      "We  did  not  have  a  definite  identification  until  late  yesterday  afternoon in  any  case\n",
      "Poor  Francis\n",
      "He  rang  me  last  night very  kindly principally  I  think  to  assure  me  that  there  could  be  no  doubt\n",
      "That  it  was  Angela I  mean\n",
      "I 'm  very  sorry\n",
      "Were  you  there  too\n",
      "Did  you  see  Francis  Mr  Morgan\n",
      "Yes we  were although  it  was  a  Cambridge  officer  who  broke  the  news  because  I  did n't  want  any  delay  in  case  the  Press  got  it\n",
      "We  were  actually  with  him  when  he  made  the  identification though\n",
      "I 've  been  to  that  riding-stable  Angela 's  sister  Jennifer  and  I  went  hacking  one  day  when  I  stayed  the  weekend  there\n",
      "It 's  an  excellent  stable  they  produced  a  very  good  hunter  for  me  once  Jennifer  had  assured  them  I  was  safe\n",
      "I  ca n't  remember  it  all but  I  think  we  rode  along  the  old  railway  line\n",
      "He  bit  his  lip  and  looked  into  the  remorseless even  flames\n",
      "I  was  just  following  Jennifer 's  lead\n",
      "You  only  went  once\n",
      "Twice\n",
      "Angela  did n't  ride though  she  had  done  as  a   child\n",
      "I  told  you I  think that  I  had  met  Jennifer  first some  time  ago\n",
      "Indeed\n",
      "Well it  was  interesting McLeish  thought  gravely making  an  unnecessary  note that  Giles  Hawick  had  admitted  unprompted  to  the  local  knowledge  necessary  for  disposing  of  Angela  Morgan 's  body  in  that  particular  place\n",
      "But  it  had  been  the  older  sister  he  had  gone  there  with and  had  apparently  abandoned  in  favour  of  the  younger more  exciting  girl\n",
      "He  decided  he  was n't  going  to  get  anywhere  along  those  lines or  not  yet and  went  over  again  the  details  of  when  Hawick  had  last  seen  his  fiancée\n",
      "He  found  his  account as  he  would  have  expected consistent and  considered  the  man  carefully  as  he  did  so\n",
      "For  all  his  ambition Hawick  was  obviously  a  man  of  strong  passions  and for  McLeish 's  money well  capable  of  murder\n",
      "There  was however no  apparent  motive McLeish  reminded  himself and  he  must  not  let  his  own  uneasy  conviction  that  Angela  Morgan  would  have  been  more  than  capable  of  stirring  up  strong  and  complex  emotions  in  those  around  her  cloud  his  judgement\n",
      "Time  to  ask  the  obvious  question\n",
      "We 're  at  a  very  early  stage  in  all  this Minister but  can  you  think  of  anyone  who  would  have  wanted  to  harm  Miss  Morgan\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "McLeish  blinked  at  him startled\n",
      "Yes I  can  think  of  one  or  two  people  who  might  have  wanted  to  harm  her as  you  suggest\n",
      "None  who  might  have  carried  that  wish  to  the  length  of  killing  her\n",
      "I  take  it  her  death  can not  have  been  accidental\n",
      "Probably  not McLeish  agreed thinking  of  the  misshapen  skull\n",
      "Who  had  reason  to  wish  her  ill then\n",
      "She  was  left  a  large  legacy  by  an  ex-employer\n",
      "His  niece who  is  a  little  unbalanced took  this  very  badly despite  the  fact  she  herself  was  a  substantial  legatee\n",
      "She  certainly  made  threats  against  Angela  and  has  bothered  her  recently\n",
      "This  is  a  woman  called  Penelope  Huntley\n",
      "I 've  never  spoken  to  her  myself  but  I  know  Angela  had  found  it  necessary  to  get  her  solicitor  to  write\n",
      "McLeish  made  a  note\n",
      "We  have n't  been  able  yet  to  speak   to  Miss  Morgan 's  solicitor he  observed\n",
      "Do  you  know  if  she  left  a  will\n",
      "Indeed  she  did\n",
      "We  both  made  new  wills  last  week in  expectation  of  marriage\n",
      "We  each  left  the  bulk  of  our  estates  to  the  other with  a  couple  of  minor  legacies  my  old  college  and  a  couple  of  godchildren  on  my  side and  her  sister  on  hers\n",
      "Do  you  know  what  Miss  Morgan 's  previous  will  provided\n",
      "No I  do n't\n",
      "But  that  will of  course is  the  only  one  that 's  valid\n",
      "We  never  married\n",
      "The  wide  mouth  twisted\n",
      "So  the  wills  we  made  last  week  are  irrelevant\n",
      "He  looked  suddenly  tired  and  old the  deep  lines  in  his  face  intensified\n",
      "There  were  probably  professional  jealousies  in  Angela 's  life too he  said wearily rubbing  the  patch  between  his  eyebrows  in  a  gesture  McLeish  recognized  from  his  television  appearances\n",
      "You  mean  she  could  have  run  into  trouble  as  a  result  of  her  professional  activities he  asked cautiously\n",
      "I  hope  not\n",
      "I  must  say  I  was  not  totally  happy  about  her  going  on  at  Yeo  Davis with  me  in  the  government\n",
      "But  she  was  very  reluctant  to  give  it  up  and  there  is  a  precedent\n",
      "One  of  my  Ministerial  colleagues  is  married  to  a  partner  in  a  firm  specializing  in  financial  public  relations  where  there  are  similar  possibilities  for  conflict  of  interest\n",
      "But  maybe  your  Ministerial  colleague  is n't  going  right  for  the  very  top McLeish  thought  with  unreasonable  conviction and  you  were  going  to  stop  her  working  at  Yeo  Davis  when  you  could\n",
      "He  glanced  up  and  found  the  cool  blue  eyes  on  him\n",
      "That  being  said anyone  will  tell  you  that  a  Minister  of  the  Crown  needs  a  wife  capable  of  supporting  him\n",
      "It 's  one  of  those  jobs  where  the  pay  does n't  actually  cover  the  cost  of  the  lifestyle and  you  can  be  out  on  you  one  day  and  the  next\n",
      "But  I  think  we  would  have  tried  to  find  her  a  job  rather  more  removed  from  mine over  time\n",
      "A  very  fair  admission McLeish  thought  admiringly and  made  his  standard  speech  about  the  need if  he  might to  come  back  on  various  points  as  they  occurred  to  him\n",
      "Of  course  you  must\n",
      "Just  so  long  as  you  are  not  intending  to  ask  me  not  to  leave  London\n",
      "I 'm  in  Newcastle  tomorrow  and  the  day  after and  next  week  I  have  several  days  in  Washington\n",
      "I  have  told  you  where  I  was  already\n",
      "He  hesitated\n",
      "I 'm  assuming  she  was  killed  on  the  Saturday of  course when  she  first  went  missing as  we  now  know\n",
      "I  hope  so\n",
      "I  mean  it  would  be  worse  if  she  had  been  hurt  first\n",
      "McLeish  instantly  understood  the  man 's  nightmare  but  realized  he  could  give  only  qualified  reassurance\n",
      "She  was  probably  killed  by  a  blow  on  the  head Minister\n",
      "We  have  not  had  the  autopsy  result\n",
      "Can  you  let  me  know\n",
      "Certainly\n",
      "He  and  Catherine  took  their  leave  and  crammed  themselves  again  into  the  rickety  lift\n",
      "It  was  another  windy sunny  day the  brilliant  February  sun  which  has  no  strength  in  it  but  still  gives  the  reassurance  that  summer  will  come  and  a  sun  will  shine  with  real  warmth  again\n",
      "Discarded  papers  blew  in  the  narrow  street  as  they  walked  back  to  the  car\n",
      "John excuse  me\n",
      "Are  we  allowed  to  tell  people  involved  in  the  case  what  the  autopsy  result  is\n",
      "If  that  one 's  a  murderer  he  knows  what  happened\n",
      "If  he  is n't it  does n't  matter  what  he  knows  and  he  can  go  over  my  head  any  day  he  likes  and  make  the  Assistant  Commissioner  read  him  the  whole  report  if  he  wants  to\n",
      "No  point  me  being  difficult\n",
      "He  got  a  respectful  sideways  look which  he  appreciated and  smiled  down  at  her\n",
      "Did  you  think  he  was  a  murderer Catherine\n",
      "Well  capable  of  it if  crossed she  said promptly\n",
      "But  I  ca n't  see  the  motive\n",
      "What  about  if  Angela  Morgan  was  involved  with  another  bloke  and  he  found  out\n",
      "Yes then\n",
      "But  not  if  he  had  time  to  think  what  it  would  do  to  his  career\n",
      "McLeish  grinned\n",
      "He 's  too  ambitious\n",
      "He 's  one  of  these  blokes  where  he  comes  number  1 2  and  3 and  anyone  else  comes  nowhere\n",
      "There  was  real  feeling  in  this  judgement McLeish  decided and  tried  to  imagine   what  kind  of  man  had  decided  to  relegate  Catherine  Crane  to  fourth  place  in  his  scheme  of  things\n",
      "In  a  windy cold  field  in  Cambridgeshire green  with  winter  wheat half  a  mile  away  from  where  Angela  Morgan 's  body  had  been  found a  small  man  with  a  narrow turned-down  mouth  sat  smoking  his  twentieth  cigarette  of  the  day  at  the  wheel  of  a  Land  Rover\n",
      "He  arrived  at  a  decision threw  the  cigarette  away and  turned  towards  a  small  depressing  row  of  agricultural  cottages\n",
      "He  emerged  two  minutes  later  with  a  bulky  small  man and  the  Land  Rover  turned  on  to  the  Cambridge  road making  for  the  headquarters  of  the  regional  crime  squad\n",
      "An  hour  later  the  phone  rang  in  New  Scotland  Yard  where  John  McLeish  was  sitting  reading  the  scene-of-crime  report\n",
      "A  what\n",
      "Yes sorry of  course  I 've  heard  of  ploughs\n",
      "My  mind  was n't  with  you\n",
      "Standing  there was  it\n",
      "Yes I 've  got  the  scene-of-crime  report hang  on  yes deep  tracks evidently  belonging  to  a  tractor plus  other  deep  tracks query  agricultural  machinery\n",
      "Well you  ca n't  blame  them Sergeant they 're  like  me not  used  to  the  country real  townees\n",
      "It  was  a  plough was  it\n",
      "He  listened  as  the  Cambridgeshire  sergeant  explained  that  the  keeper  on  the  shooting  estate  had  realized  he  had  seen  the  old  plough  there  last  week  and  had  fetched  the  farmer  in  to  explain  where  it  had  gone\n",
      "He  says  he  never  saw  a  body  when  he  moved  it\n",
      "He  was  very  unhappy  at  having  to  come  out  at  all but  I  think  he  s  just  pig-ignorant  rather  than  involved\n",
      "Do  you  want  me  to  send  someone  to  look  at  the  plough\n",
      "Have  you  seen  it\n",
      "No\n",
      "I 'll  go  if  I  must but  we  have n't  got  any  forensic  people  here it  being  Sunday\n",
      "I  can  get  them  out of  course\n",
      "No I 'll  send  a  couple  of  my  blokes as  soon  as  I  can\n",
      "Could  you  do  us  a  real  favour\n",
      "Make  sure  the  vehicle  is  under  cover  so  if  there  is  anything  on  it prints whatever that  haven  t  already  gone we  get  them\n",
      "I  mean do n't  let  the  farmer  clean  it or  anything  dead  stupid\n",
      "The  sergeant  at  the  other  end  said  grimly  that  the  bloke   was  quite  thick  enough  to  do  just  that so  due  precautions  would  be  taken\n",
      "I 'll  go  myself  in  fact\n",
      "No it 's  no  bother it 's  on  my  way  home\n",
      "Give  your  blokes  this  number  so  they  can  arrange  a  visit but  I 'll  have  a  quick  look  while  I 'm  there\n",
      "John  McLeish  was  feeling  justifiably  pleased  with  himself  as  he  walked  into  his  office  at  eight  o'clock  on  Monday  morning\n",
      "He  had  devoted  Sunday  evening  to  making  a  plan  of  action  and  knew  exactly  what  he  and  everyone  else  he  could  press  into  service  was  going  to  be  doing  this  morning\n",
      "His  schedule  for  the  day  was  organized thanks  to  some  brisk  telephoning  the  night  before and  he  would  have  Catherine  Crane  at  his  side  all  day and  all  the  days  until  this  case  finished\n",
      "He  arrived  at  his  desk squinted  at  the  offering  tucked  into  his  blotter  and  sat  down  to  read  it  properly a  short sanctimonious  newspaper  piece  on  the  temptation  and  pressures  on  the  successful  young Tristram  Wilson  being  mentioned with  many  a  crocodile  tear as  one  of  the  recent  casualties\n",
      "It  was  presumably  Bruce  Davidson who  admired  and  was  annoyed  by  Francesca  in  about  equal  measure and  therefore  took  an  unremitting  interest  in  all  her  activities who  had  favoured  him  with  this\n",
      "McLeish  threw  it  away  and  methodically  sorted  his  notes he  was  not  going  near  a  top  firm  of  solicitors  without  a  very  careful  list  of  questions and  his  first  port  of  call  that  morning  was  to  be  Huttons who  had  been  Angela  Morgan 's  solicitors\n",
      "He  and  Catherine  were  ushered  into  the  presence  of  Mr  Timothy  Hutton who  was  housed  in  outwardly  featureless  modern  offices  in  one  of  the  little  streets  off  Ludgate  Hill\n",
      "The  view  from  the  window  featured  a  building  site  and  a  large  collection  of  assorted  earth-moving  machinery  and  cranes all  displayed  simultaneously\n",
      "Even  through  double  glazing  there  was  a  dull continuous  background  noise and  the  huge  modern  windows  were  dusty  in  the  February  sun\n",
      "The  furniture  and  fittings  were  ruthlessly  modern several  steps  beyond  the  conventional  Scandinavian\n",
      "Mr  Hutton 's  desk  was  a  shaped  piece  of  black  wood  with  a  single  file  on  it and  the  heavily  bound  books  that  covered  one  wall  appeared  to  be  held  there  by  the  power  of  faith no  shelves  being  visible\n",
      "The  owner  was  also  uncompromisingly  twentieth-century a  man  of  much  the  same  height  and  age  as  McLeish  but  built  like  a  string  bean with  brown short-cut  hair  and  fashionable  heavy  horn-rimmed  spectacles\n",
      "He  greeted  them  briskly  and  folded  himself  into  a  chair\n",
      "McLeish  noted  enviously  that  Mr  Hutton  was  a  vision  of  elegance  in  one  of  this  year 's  broadly  striped  blue  and  white  shirts he  had  tried  one  on  himself  recently and  had  been  forced  reluctantly  to  the  conclusion  that  he  looked  like  a  bouncer  for  an  East  End  club\n",
      "Dreadful  thing  about  Miss  Morgan Timothy  Hutton  said  earnestly\n",
      "We  were  all  very  shocked  I  told  my  partners  at  prayers  this  morning\n",
      "Sorry that 's  what  we  call  the  Monday  morning  meeting  where  we  discuss  what 's  going  on\n",
      "How  can  I  help  you\n",
      "You  can  tell  us please what  Miss  Morgan 's  property  was  and  how  her  will  distributes  it\n",
      "I  understand  that  you  are  her  executor\n",
      "I  am yes\n",
      "With  her  father\n",
      "I 've  just  looked  it  up\n",
      "I  did n't of  course expect  to  have  to  not  quite  so  soon\n",
      "He  opened  the  file  and  considered  it unhurriedly  and  unselfconsciously and  McLeish  had  a  sudden  vision  of  an  older  Mr  Hutton  in  a  tail-coat  and  wing  collar  behind  this  modern  façade\n",
      "We  have  two  wills  on  file Timothy  Hutton  said reaching  the  end  of  whatever  internal  debate  he  had  been  having but  the  second which  was  made  in  anticipation  of  her  marriage  to  Mr  Hawick can not  of  course  be  submitted  for  Probate  since  that  marriage  did  not  take  place\n",
      "So  it 's  the  first  will  she  made  what eighteen  months  ago which  is  valid\n",
      "McLeish  said  promptly  that  he  would  need  to  know  the  contents  of  both  wills  as  well  as  details  of  Miss  Morgan 's  estate and  Timothy  Hutton  considered  him  carefully\n",
      "Yes I  see  you  do he  agreed and  I 'm  not  here  to  make  difficulties\n",
      "Look I  need  to  explain  a  bit  of  background\n",
      "Angela  was  very  comfortably  off\n",
      "Just  over  two  years  ago  she  benefited  very  considerably  from  the  will  of  a  chap  called  William  Coombes who  was  senior  partner  in  one  of  the  second-rank  stockbrokers\n",
      "They  do  all  right those  chaps even  after  taxes\n",
      "She  got  about  two  hundred  thousand  and  a  life  interest  in  another  two  hundred  thou\n",
      "The  family  wanted  to  dispute  the  will and  that 's  when  Angela  Miss  Morgan  came  to  us  for  advice\n",
      "Well Coombes  was  only  sixty-two  when  he  died  it  was  a  heart  attack there  was  nothing  wrong  with  his  brains\n",
      "The  family  did n't  have  a  leg  to  stand  on  and  so  I  advised\n",
      "They  caved  in I  mean  it  was  only  a  sister  and  a  niece and  they 'd  both  been  provided  for  during  his  lifetime  and  the  niece  got  a  couple  of  hundred  thou  in  his  will\n",
      "But  the  niece  was  very  bitter  about  it  I  had  to  write  a  letter  to  her  solicitors  a  year  or  so  later  because  she 'd  been  bothering  Angela  long  after  the  estate  was  settled\n",
      "McLeish  thought  his  way  through  this  one drawing  a  diagram  on  the  edge  of  his  notes\n",
      "Miss  Morgan  got  some  of  it  just  for  life\n",
      "Who  gets  it  now then\n",
      "The  niece the  one  I 've  been  telling  you  about\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley\n",
      "I  can  give  you  the  address  of  her  solicitors  Kenwards two-partner  firm  in  Kensington\n",
      "I 'll  look  for  it\n",
      "Go  on  asking  me  things\n",
      "How  old  is  Miss  Huntley\n",
      "Same  age  as  Angela\n",
      "I  agree she  would  not  normally  have  expected  the  remainder  to  fall  in  and  be  useful  to  her but  of  course  if  she  had  had  children it  would  have  been  valuable  to  them\n",
      "But  if  you  were  Penelope  Huntley  you  might  not  have  been  consoled  by  the  thought  that  your  children  would  inherit  after  Miss  Morgan 's  death\n",
      "No I  would n't\n",
      "Nor  was  she\n",
      "Sorry\n",
      "That 's  what  she  kept  writing  to  Angela  about\n",
      "Her  lawyer  had  advised  her  that  she  could by  agreement  with  Angela break  the  trust\n",
      "They 're  both  were  both  well  over  twenty-one and  they  could  have  made  a  deal  which   essentially  bought  out  Angela 's  life  interest  for  a  capital  sum  and  then  Miss  Huntley  would  have  got  the  rest\n",
      "McLeish  thought  that  it  seemed  a  reasonably  sensible  plan\n",
      "Is  that  very  difficult  to  do he  asked cautiously\n",
      "No\n",
      "It 's  a  routine  valuation  exercise  based  on  actuarial  tables\n",
      "I  do n't  think  it  would  have  done  Miss  Huntley  a  lot  of  good  financially  though given  that  Angela  was  only  twenty-nine  and  actuarially  good  for  another  forty  years\n",
      "McLeish  considered  him  with  pleasure\n",
      "His  last  interview  with  a  solicitor  had  been  conducted  in  a  language  barely  recognizable  as  English  and  it  had  taken  over  three  hours  and  a  reference  to  the  Chief  Constable  to  elicit  the  fact  that  the  deceased  had  made  a  previous  will  in  which  the  respective  positions  of  his  wife  and  his  mistress  had  been  exactly  reversed\n",
      "As  McLeish  had  observed  to  a  colleague  at  the  ti  me he 'd  have  understood  the  whole  performance  if  the  solicitor  in  question  had  been  going  to  marry  either  of  them but  there  had  been  no  question  of  that it  was  just  obfuscation  for  its  own  sake\n",
      "He  decided to  make  sure  he  had  this  clear\n",
      "So  Miss  Morgan  would  have  got  the  lion 's  share  of  the  other  two  hundred  thousand  even  if  she  had  agreed  to  break  up  the  trust\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Then  why  did  she  not  agree  to  it\n",
      "Or  was  she  going  to\n",
      "Timothy  Hutton  stopped  hunting  in  the  file\n",
      "He  spread  both  hands  on  the  table  in  an  aid  to  thought  and  McLeish  noticed  how  long  the  fingers  were\n",
      "Sorry\n",
      "She  would n't  do  it  at  the  time because  she  felt  the  whole  issue  ought  to  be  allowed  to  settle  down\n",
      "It  was  very  difficult you  know  Miss  Huntley  was  bitter  and  there  was  an  extremely  unpleasant  scene  in  Kenwards 's  offices\n",
      "The  partner  there  was  terribly  embarrassed rang  me  up  and  apologized  for  hours  afterwards could n't  get  him  off  the  phone\n",
      "So  Angela  did n't  want  to  get  involved  she  did n't  need  the  capital after  all  and  she  said  to  me  she  might  do  it  in  a  year  or  so  when  Miss  Huntley  had  calmed  down\n",
      "He  gazed  at  his  hands and  visibly  played  this  back  to  himself then  looked  across  at  McLeish and  put  his  glasses  on\n",
      "Look I 'm  not  saying  Angela  actually  refused\n",
      "Sorry I  can   hear  how  it  sounds\n",
      "She  said  or  rather  I  did to  her  solicitors  that  she  would  consider  it  again  in  a  year  or  so  when  everyone  was  calmer\n",
      "McLeish  flipped  back  through  his  notes\n",
      "Catherine  was  so  quiet  that  she  might  as  well  not  have  been  in  the  room  and  it  occurred  to  him  that  he  must  train  her  to  make  some  unobtrusive  signal  to  him  when  she  thought  he  was  missing  something\n",
      "You  said Mr  Hutton that  a  letter  had  been  written\n",
      "Her  cool  voice with  the  slight  nasal  edge  of  Stoke  on  Trent came  from  behind  him and  Timothy  Hutton  looked  up  sharply\n",
      "Did  I\n",
      "Well yes there  was  one\n",
      "Not  to  me to  Angela but  she  showed  it  to  me\n",
      "His  glance  towards  the  file  told  them  precisely  where  that  letter  was  and  McLeish  asked  for  it  promptly\n",
      "Hutton  extracted  it  with  every  evidence  of  reluctance\n",
      "Bit  hysterical he  said apologetically\n",
      "Yes indeed McLeish  thought working  his  way  through  the  letter\n",
      "Is  this  a  copy\n",
      "No no it 's  the  original\n",
      "That 's  how  it  came\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley  must  have  thought  about  it\n",
      "Not  exactly  guaranteed  to  encourage  my  client  to  do  anything\n",
      "What  did  you  do\n",
      "Wrote  a  snotty  letter  to  the  poor  chap  at  Kenwards  I  rang  him  up  first of  course he  was  embarrassed  all  over  again  asking  him  to  ask  his  client  to  leave  mine  alone\n",
      "I 'll  get  you  a  copy\n",
      "He  reached  his  hand  for  a  bell but  Catherine 's  voice  checked  him\n",
      "So as  matters  stand that  £200,000  passes  to  Miss  Huntley\n",
      "It  does n't  matter  what  Miss  Morgan 's  will  says\n",
      "Yes that 's  right\n",
      "It  is  part  of  William  Coombes 's  estate  and  passes  under  his  will\n",
      "He  looked  at  her  carefully  to  see  he  had  made  himself  clear then  resumed  his  search  through  the  file\n",
      "You  wanted  to  know  what  was  in  Angela 's  will  the  one  we 're  going  to  prove that  is\n",
      "I 'll  get  you  a  copy but  it 's  absolutely  straightforward\n",
      "It 's  left  to  her  sister after  decent  legacies  for  both  parents  and  small  ones  to  charity and  to  her  sister 's  children  if  the  sister  predeceases\n",
      "Sorry irrelevant  now of  course\n",
      "It 's  the  sort  of  will  young  women  without  husbands  or  children  do  make\n",
      "The  second  one  the  one  she  made  a  couple  of  weeks  ago  i-s  a  bit  more  complicated but  not  much\n",
      "Giles  Hawick  would  have  got  £100,000  outright her  sister  and  various  charities  got  small  legacies and  the  rest  was  to  be  in  trust  for  children\n",
      "What  if  there  were n't  any\n",
      "Her  sister  Jennifer  would  have  got  it\n",
      "Let  me  see  I  have  it  right McLeish  said after  a  pause\n",
      "If  she  had  married  before  she  died the  sister  would  only  have  got  a  small  legacy\n",
      "But  Miss  Huntley  would  still  inherit  £200,000  on  Miss  Morgan 's  death whenever  that  happened\n",
      "Timothy  Hutton  nodded  and  took  his  glasses  off and  McLeish  realized  that  he  did n't  actually  need  them\n",
      "You  have n't  asked  me  what 's  in  the  estate and  I 've  got  a  list  of  assets  here\n",
      "He  passed  it  over  the  table and  courteously  got  up  to  give  Catherine  a  second  copy\n",
      "The  problem  item  appeared  right  at  the  bottom  of  the  page in  what  McLeish  decided  was  characteristic  legal  style  you  did n't  hide  it you  just  put  it  last after  the  long  respectable  list  of  £20,000\n",
      "ICI  loan  stock and  7,000  25p  shares  in  Sainsbury\n",
      "This  is  a  loan  of  £100,000  to  Yeo  Davis\n",
      "Her  employers\n",
      "Well it 's  the  amount  she  was  asked  to  put  up  when  she  became  a  partner  last  year\n",
      "Is  that  usual\n",
      "Difficult  to  say\n",
      "Timothy  Hutton  was  looking  uncomfortable  and  McLeish  said  that  it  just  seemed  a  lot  to  him\n",
      "I  mean I  imagine  a  lot  of  people  might  have  difficulty  raising  that  much\n",
      "Yes  and  no\n",
      "She  drew  something  like  £30,000  from  the  partnership  last  year\n",
      "People  can  borrow  on  that\n",
      "But  I  did  think  it  was  a  lot and  I  tell  you  why I  ca n't  really  see  what  a  group  of  professionals  charging  fees  like  that  needs  cash  for\n",
      "When  we  started  here  we  only  put  in  about  £100,000  between  four  of  us to  keep  us  going  till  the  fees  came  in and  that  was  more  than  enough\n",
      "And  Yeo  Davis  charge  a  good  deal  more  than  we  do I  can  tell  you\n",
      "In  some  sense  Angela  may  have  been  paying  for  the  assets  they  had  assets  valued  at  £600,000  then most  of  it  in  the  lease  on  the  building\n",
      "But  you  usually  deal  with  that  by  giving  new   partners  uneven  shares\n",
      "Say  the  profits  come  out  at  £500,000 then  senior  partner  gets  £200,000 second  partner  £100,000  and  so  on\n",
      "It 's  not  usual  to  make  new  partners  put  up  a  lot  of  cash\n",
      "McLeish  contemplated  this  and  decided  he  would  have  to  find  out  more  about  Yeo  Davis 's  financial  affairs\n",
      "What  happens  to  that  loan  now\n",
      "It  was  Catherine  again  and  McLeish  was  mildly  irritated  by  the  way  she  seemed  to  be  ahead  of  him\n",
      "I 'm  looking  at  the  partnership  agreement  now trm trm trm here  we  are  death  in  partnership  well it  dissolves  the  partnership course  it  does but  what  happens  to  the  money\n",
      "Ah  yes the  partnership  has  a  year  to  give  it  back\n",
      "I  remember  saying  this  was  a  bit  leisurely was n't  it but  there  was  some  apparently  reasonable  explanation like  no  one  gave  any  notice  that  they  were  going  to  die  and  the  partnership  could  be  a  bit  pushed  to  produce  the  cash  if  it  was  the  wrong  time  of  year\n",
      "And  of  course  none  of  us  were  particularly  exercised  about  death  as  a  real  possibility\n",
      "As  executor I 'll  ask  for  it  back  formally but  I  wo n't  hold  my  breath\n",
      "It 's  interest-free so  I 'd  expect  to  get  it  in  eleven  months  and  twenty-nine  days  from  giving  notice\n",
      "The  phone  rang  and  Hutton  picked  it  up glancing  at  his  watch\n",
      "Yes yes  I  know\n",
      "I 'll  be  along  as  soon  as  I  can what five  minutes\n",
      "He  looked  enquiringly  at  McLeish\n",
      "Fine\n",
      "He  banged  the  phone  down  briskly  and  sat clearly  working  out  what  else  he  could  offer  to  get  them  to  go\n",
      "Amused McLeish  said  that  he  would  be  happy  to  wait  in  an  outer  office  for  copies  of  the  various  documents or  to  have  them  sent  on\n",
      "What  would  happen  if  anyone  just  wanted  to  get  out  of  the  partnership  I  mean without  a  death  being  involved\n",
      "McLeish  asked as  they  stood  up\n",
      "Six  months '  notice both  ways and  any  loans  repaid  within  that  period\n",
      "Pretty  much  a  standard  period\n",
      "Lots  of  provisions  against  stealing  clients  subsequently of  course\n",

      "Nice  to  meet  you Chief  Inspector he  said  with  automatic  politeness then  considered  what  he  had  just  said decided  it  was  beyond  explanation  and  led  them  upstairs  to  his  office\n",
      "This  echoed  the  prevailing  Italian-restaurant  theme except  for  the  large  comfortable  mahogany  desk  which  featured  reassuring  and  recognizable  objects  like  drawers  and  blotters\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  himself  was  an  old-fashioned  and  recognizable  object McLeish  thought seeing  him  against  the  rapidly  fading  light  from  the  window\n",
      "It  had  been  Bruce  Davidson  who  had  interviewed  Yeo  before when  Angela  Morgan  had  still  been  officially  only  a  Missing  Person  and  Peter  Yeo as  her  employer one  of  the  obvious  people  to  talk  to  about  where  she  might  be\n",
      "He  considered  him  as  he  caused  coffee  to  be  produced  and  established  them  at  the  big  table  at  the  other  end  of  his  room\n",
      "Given  a  choice you  would  have  taken  him  rather  than  Timothy  Hutton  for  a  solicitor\n",
      "With  his  conventional  double-breasted  suit carefully  cut  to  disguise  a  distinctly  stocky  figure and  his  watchful  courtesy  he  was  in  sharp  contrast  to  Hutton 's  hard-edged  efficiency\n",
      "The  difference  was  partly  generational this  man  must  be  ten  years  older  than  Hutton\n",
      "The  real  distinction  however McLeish  thought  in  a  flash  of  revelation lay  in  their  clients '  expectations\n",
      "Yeo  Davis 's  business  was  concerned  with  representing  people  who  did  not  know  the  ropes or  even  that  there  were  any  ropes Hutton 's  predominantly  with  fellow  professionals  in  other  fields  who  just  wanted  the  best  and  swiftest  way  through\n",
      "So  Peter  Yeo  had  to  look  reassuring  and  solid  and  a  bit  older while  Timothy  Hutton  could  probably  have  come  to  work  in  striped  organza  without  losing  a  single  client\n",
      "He  abandoned  this  line  of  observation  and  looked  carefully  at  the  man  inside  the  suit\n",
      "The  impression  of  suppressed  energy  which  he  had  received  as  he  arrived  was   intensified Peter  Yeo  could  barely  sit  still  and  was  discharging  tension  by  moving  papers  on  his  desk then  fiddling  with  the  Venetian  blinds  to  prevent  the  sun  from  shining  in  Catherine 's  eyes\n",
      "The  bright  blue  eyes  looked  a  bit  bloodshot and  there  was  a  flush  of  colour  across  the  cheekbones\n",
      "Yeo  rubbed  the  back  of  his  neck  irritably and  reached  for  his  coffee downing  two  cups  while  McLeish  and  Catherine  Crane  were  still  passing  each  other  milk  and  sugar\n",
      "A  thick  weekend McLeish  decided trying  to  think  how  best  to  establish  what  Yeo 's  relationship  had  been  with  the  dead  girl\n",
      "He  started as  he  had  intended from  where  the  last  interview  had  left  off  and  went  quickly  over  the  ground  again\n",
      "Last  Friday yes ten  days  ago was  the  last  time  I  saw  her Yeo  confirmed\n",
      "Around  five  o'clock  she  left  early  because  she  was  meeting  Giles\n",
      "Giles  Hawick yes\n",

      "Not  while  I  was  here\n",
      "I  was  in oh from  about  ten  o'clock  to  well  after  lunch and  I  would n't  have  thought  she  would  come  in  late  in  the  afternoon\n",
      "I  mean it 's  not  a  bad  idea Chief  Inspector\n",
      "She  often  was  in  on  Saturday\n",
      "We  own  the  building  and  all  the  partners  have  keys so  unless  someone  else  was  here  she  could  have  been  in  and  out  without  anyone  noticing\n",

      "Could  you  tell  me perhaps  with  an  example\n",
      "He  observed  from  the  way  peter  Yeo  gathered  himself  and  sat  up  straight  that  he  was  on  familiar  territory and  understood  further  that  the  general  patter  was  well  rehearsed\n",
      "It  was for  obvious  reasons a  great  deal  less  incisive  than  Francesca 's  summary but  the  same  skeleton  was  recognizable  under  the  attractive  padding  placed  round  it  by  Peter  Yeo\n",
      "Much  emphasis  was  put  on  the  importance  of  identifying  the  key  decision-takers  and  making  sure  that  they  had  the  right  information  much  was  made  of  the  necessity  of  their  getting  a  balanced  picture  on  which  to  take  their  decisions\n",
      "Ours  is  not  unlike  the  job  of  a  good  barrister Peter  Yeo  observed reaching  a  peroration\n",
      "We  try  to  make  sure  the  judge  has  all  the  facts  before  arriving  at  a  decision\n",
      "Mostly  we  do  this  by  ensuring  that  our  client  gets  to  talk  to  the  decision-takers\n",
      "There  is  no  point  at  all  in  my  talking  to  those  people except  on  a  preliminary  basis they 're  not  that  interested  in  my  views\n",
      "I  do  the  background  briefing  but  the  clients  have  to  do  most  of  the  work and  so  I  always  tell  them\n",
      "McLeish  decided  this  was  good  stuff  from  which but  for  Francesca he  would  have  gained  no  clear  idea  of  what  a  firm  like  Yeo 's  was  really  for\n",
      "So  you  would for  instance have  lunch  with  people  in  government  departments  to  talk  to  them  about  particular  policies\n",
      "Yes often  that  is  the  best  way  to  start\n",
      "We 've  got  a  lot  of  friends  whom  we  can  talk  to  about  a  policy  generally and  where  we  can  put  a  word  in\n",
      "Let  me  try  and  think  of  an  example  that  is n't  confidential\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "One  of  our  clients  is  Andy  Barton who  runs  the  biggest  textile  group  in  the  north-west\n",
      "Well the  DTI  is  at  this  moment  considering  giving  money  to  keep  Huerter one  of  his  main  rivals going\n",
      "A  Conservative  government if  you  believe  their  manifesto ought  not  even  to  be  considering  putting  money  into  dying  private-sector  firms but  Huerter  employ  a  lot  of  people many  of  whom  voted  for  this  government\n",
      "One  of  the  last  things  Angela  did  was  to  have  lunch  with  an  old  schoolfriend  in  the  DTI  who  is  responsible  for  the  Huerter  case to  make  sure  the  DTI  understood  the  impact  of  such  assistance  on  Barton 's  operations\n",
      "And  did  it\n",
      "McLeish  asked\n",
      "Oh  yes but  Angela  was  clear  that  the  civil  servants  were  going  nonetheless  to  recommend  assisting  Huerter\n",
      "They 've  been  rescuing  companies  for  so  long  they  do  it  automatically  now I  expect\n",
      "So  that  told  us  that  we  had  better  get  a  full-scale  defence  working  immediately\n",
      "McLeish who  had  understood  from  Francesca 's  report  of  her  lunch  that  she  and  her  seniors  were  indeed  going  to  push  for  assistance was  amused  to  hear  that  she  had  not  succeeded  in  disguising  her  intentions  from  Miss  Morgan\n",
      "Can  you  tell  me  what  you  are  going  to  advise  your  client  now\n",
      "I  mean what  is  a  full-scale  defence\n",
      "Ah well  it  varies\n",
      "I 've  got  Andy  Barton  in  to  see  the  Minister  responsible  at  the  DTI\n",
      "I 'm  keeping  the  Secretary  of  State  that 's  the  top  man  in  reserve\n",
      "And of  course we  are  arranging  to  brief  Treasury  people who  will  automatically  be  opposed  to  giving  away  public  money and  we  are  working  with  the  company  on  a  memorandum  on  what  assistance  to  Huerter  would  do  to  Barton with  a  two-page  bullet-point  summary\n",
      "Politicians  do n't  have  time  to  read  screeds so  you  have  to  give  them  short pithy  things  to  look  at We  were  doing  all  this  anyway of  course but  the  chaps  at  Barton including  Andy are  working  on  it  much  more  effectively  since  we  were  able  to  say  definitely  that  the  DTI  civil  servants  were  agin  them\n",
      "These  chaps good  blokes  who 've  spent  all  their  lives  running  businesses believed  the  government  manifesto  and  thought  that  if   they  shouted  loud  enough  in  the  local  paper Whitehall  would  crumble  and  right  would  prevail\n",
      "It 's  a  bit  more  difficult  than  that\n",
      "That  lunch  had in  fact given  a  considerable  spur  to  a  campaign  being  waged  against  the  policy  Francesca  and  her  colleagues  wanted McLeish  observed\n",
      "The  point  of  Yeo  Davis  was  now  clear they  were  there  to  inform inspire and  orchestrate  a  client 's  efforts  to  get  what  he  wanted as  efficiently  as  possible\n",
      "I 've  read  about  people  giving  MPs  expensive  lunches he  said with  interest\n",
      "Waste  of  time Peter  Yeo  said  briskly\n",
      "The  good  ones  do n't  have  time  for  long  drunken  lunches and  you  get  better  results  by  getting  them  to  give  you  and  the  client  a  sandwich  in  a  bar  at  six  p.m\n",
      "The  ones  you  can  get  for  lunch  there  are  plenty  will  likely  forget  every  word  you  tell  them and  they  certainly  do n't  feel  obliged  to  help\n",
      "He  caught  McLeish 's  eye\n",
      "Sorry but  the  fact  is  the  average  backbench  MP  does n't  know  anything unlike  the  average  civil  servant  who  really  does  know  about  his  or  her  particular  area\n",
      "It 's  only  worth  using  MPs  to  have  a  go  at  the  government and  then  you  spoon-feed  it  to  them\n",
      "The  man  had  come  to  life  very  considerably  in  discussing  his  job  and  a  formidable  personality  was  emerging\n",
      "McLeish  decided  he  would  have  to  abandon  any  prejudice  taken  from  Francesca  about  this  trade Peter  Yeo  knew  his  business  and  was  obviously  effective\n",
      "And  it  was  a  good  thing  Yeo  Davis  existed McLeish  himself  had  often  been  quietly  riled  by  the  intellectual  scorn  which  Francesca  and  her  colleagues  would  bring  to  bear  on  criticism  of  some  of  their  more  sweeping  policies\n",
      "It  might  well  have  been  necessary  to  invent  Yeo  Davis  if  they  had n't  already  existed\n",
      "He  reminded  himself  that  he  was  talking  to  the  inventor  of  the  firm  and  decided  to  prod  a  bit  further\n",
      "How  long  have  you  been  in  this  field\n",
      "I 've  spent  all  my  life  in  general  PR but  it  was  about  eight  years  ago  I  decided  that  there  was  room  for  a  specialist  agency not  really  a  PR  firm which  was  concerned  entirely  with  government  relations\n",
      "Government  in  the  widest  sense including  our  masters  in  Brussels\n",
      "I  have   had  four  partners and  we  have  another  twenty  people  working  for  us\n",
      "McLeish  glanced  at  the  clock  on  Yeo 's  desk  and  saw  that  he  was  running  behind  ti  me as  tended  to  happen  at  this  stage  in  an  investigation  when  you  needed  to  be  in  six  places  at  once\n",
      "He  considered  his  notes what  he  needed  from  this  interview  was  to  confirm  that  Angela  Morgan  had  not  been  in  the  office  on  Saturday and  a  statement  of  Peter  Yeo 's  movements  over  the  period  within  which  Angela  Morgan  had  probably  been  killed\n",
      "He  also  did  need  to  understand  the  financial  side\n",
      "Was  Miss  Morgan  about  the  same  age  as  the  rest  of  your  partners\n",
      "No no she  was  the  youngest  by  a  good  five  years\n",
      "She  is  was  outstandingly  able that 's  why  I  asked  her  to  join  us\n",
      "McLeish  noted  the  absence  of  reference  to  the  other  partners\n",
      "Yeo  Davis evidently c'est  moi  as  far  as  Peter  Yeo  was  concerned\n",
      "I 'd  like  to  confirm  what  the  financial  arrangements  were\n",
      "I  mean  how  much  did  she  get  paid and  how  much  capital  was  she  asked  to  put  up that  sort  of  thing\n",
      "Yes I  suppose  you  do\n",
      "Well you  understand  about  partnerships do  you\n",
      "None  of  the  partners  here  is  actually  entitled  to  a  salary in  theory  we  split  the  profits  in  accordance  with  a  formula  that  we  fix  annually  and  that  takes  account  of  age and  experience  and  what  people  are  contributing  in  terms  of  work  or  clients\n",
      "As  a  matter  of  practice and  because  we 've  all  got  to  live we  all  draw  about  two-thirds  of  what  we  would  have  got  last  year  as  we  go  along then  share  out  the  rest  at  the  end  of  the  year\n",
      "McLeish  contemplated  this  system  and  its  possible  application  to  the  Metropolitan  police  force  and  felt  imagination  boggle\n",
      "He  himself  would  have  been  desperately  pushed  if  he  had  had  to  manage  on  two-thirds  of  his  salary  until  Christmas  every  year\n",
      "A  moment 's  thought  told  him  that  this  system  worked  only  because  two-thirds  of  the  expected  total  of  a  Yeo  Davis  partnership  came  out  at  an  amount  well  in  excess  of  his  salary or  that  of  any  public  servant  of  his  age\n",
      "He  asked  what  Angela  Morgan  had  been  drawing   on  every  month  and  found  his  belief  confirmed\n",
      "Christmas  must  be  worth  having  at  Yeo  Davis\n",
      "What  about  tax he  asked still  considering  the  mechanics  of  the  system\n",
      "All  partners  are  technically  self-employed  but  in  order  to  prevent  them  from  getting  into  a  frightful  mess  we  deduct  a  percentage  from  their  drawings so  there  is  something  put  aside  for  tax\n",
      "I 'd  have  to  say  it 's  a  great  deal  lower  percentage  than  most  employed  people  pay  because  there  are  all  sorts  of  expenses  a  partnership  can  claim\n",
      "If  we  seem  to  have  got  it  wrong we  sort  it  out  when  we  divvy  up  the  profit\n",
      "McLeish  made  a  conscientious  note feeling  that  he  had  got  himself  sidetracked  off  the  more  interesting  question  of  Angela  Morgan 's  capital  investment  in  Yeo  Davis\n",
      "Finding  no  way  other  than  the  direct  question he  put  it and  watched  Yeo unruffled confirm  that  she  had  indeed  put  up  £100,000\n",
      "The  rest  of  us  had  put  up  much  the  same given  that  we  had  done  it  earlier he  assured  McLeish\n",
      "It  seems  a  lot but  we  have  employees I  can  tell  you below  partner  level who  would  be  prepared  to  mortgage  their  children  to  get  a  partnership  here\n",
      "And  Angela  did n't  need  to  borrow  I  imagine  you 've  talked  to  her  solicitors\n",
      "Well  then you  know  that  she  was  pretty  well  placed\n",
      "I  did n't  know  that  a  business  like  this  needed  much  working  capital\n",
      "McLeish  said in  faithful  imitation  of  Timothy  Hutton\n",
      "Oh you 'd  be  surprised\n",
      "We  live  off  fees of  course but  they  can  be  slow  coming  in\n",
      "And  this  is  a  short  lease  here  we  have  to  provide  for  buying  something  or  paying  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  rent\n",
      "No that  sort  of  money  is  needed believe  me\n",
      "McLeish who  had  a  built-in  prejudice well  supported  by  experience against  statements  incorporating  an  appeal  to  belief noted  dourly  that  he  might  at  some  later  stage  need  to  get  closer  to  Yeo  Davis 's  accounts\n",
      "That  could  wait and  he  would  possibly  talk  to  Timothy  Hutton  again  first\n",
      "He  wound  up  the  interview  and  was  rising  to  say  goodbye   when  Catherine sounding  shy asked  Peter  Yeo  if  she  could  possibly  use  their  ladies '  room\n",
      "Of  course of  course\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  was  obviously  delighted  to  do  any  service however  modest for  her  and  bustled  her  away returning  belatedly  to  ask  McLeish  if  he  would  like  a  similar  facility which  he  accepted obedient  to  the  unwritten  CID  rule  that  you  looked  after  your  physical  needs  at  any  moment  that  opportunity  offered because  you  never  knew  when  you  were  going  to  get  stuck  for  hours  without  help\n",
      "He  waited  what  seemed  to  him  rather  an  excessive  ti  me  for  Catherine but  decided charitably that  you  could n't  look  as  she  did  without  pretty  regular  attention  to  the  overall  effect\n",
      "They  were  in  the  car preparing  to  drive  off before  she  spoke\n",
      "There 's  a  nice  little  flatlet  on  the  second  floor\n",
      "Bathroom bedroom  with  double  bed kitchen  off\n",
      "I  thought  there  might  be\n",
      "He  looked  at  her  sideways she  sounded  both  smug  and  irritated\n",
      "You  think  it 's  misused  regularly\n",
      "I 'd  put  money  on  it\n",
      "The  response  was  so  swift  and  unhesitating  that  McLeish  was  taken  aback and  drove  much  too  close  to  the  car  in  front\n",
      "Sorry\n",
      "You  thought  he  was  that  kind  of  bloke\n",
      "She  was  silent and  pink  across  the  cheekbones  and  McLeish who  like  all  good  policemen  depended  heavily  on  intuition understood  suddenly  that  experience  was  speaking  here\n",
      "She  laughed  shortly obviously  annoyed  with  herself  but  determined  to  make  her  point\n",
      "Well let's  say  that  I 've  heard  of  married  blokes  who  always  had  to  go  to  the  office  on  Saturdays and  it  usually  was n't  office  work  they  were  doing\n",
      "It  sounds  all  right and  if  the  wife  gets  suspicious  and  rings  up well  he 's  there is n't  he\n",
      "Not  so  good  if  the  wife  decides  to  drop  in McLeish  offered with  interest\n",
      "Well you  have  to  keep  the  office  door  locked  on  a  Saturday do n't  you\n",
      "So  you 've  got  warning she  said  dismissively and  McLeish  let  himself briefly wonder  who  the  bloke  had  been  who  had  introduced  Catherine  to  this   experience\n",
      "He  abandoned  speculation  firmly  and  concentrated  on  the  implications  for  the  present  case since  he  was  plainly  being  offered  expert  testimony\n",
      "Could  be  that  any  of  the  other  partners  used  it he  suggested\n",
      "The  place  is n't  run  like  that\n",
      "Mr  Yeo  is  the  boss is n't  he\n",
      "So  she  too  had  observed  Yeo 's  imperial  command  of  the  partnership\n",
      "No I  agree\n",
      "So  he  was  maybe  with  a  girl  on  that  Saturday\n",
      "Maybe\n",
      "I  was  wondering  about  him  and  Miss  Morgan\n",
      "I  mean he  likes  women and  she  operated  by  sleeping  with  the  boss\n",
      "McLeish  found  himself  shocked  by  this  piece  of  feminine  sharpness  and  must  have  registered  something  because  his  sergeant  blushed\n",
      "I  do n't  mean  that  like  it  sounds  she  did n't  do  it  to  get  on or  not  like  that\n",
      "Her  hands  moved in  frustration  as  she  tried  to  explain\n",
      "I  think  she  might  have  done  it  as  a  quick  way  of  finding  out  how  the  business  worked\n",
      "Because  she  was  obviously  both  clever  and  ambitious\n",
      "Mm\n",
      "McLeish  found  himself  receiving  this  with  reluctance  and  wondered  why since  it  made  sense\n",
      "He  glanced  at  her being  taken  aback  to  find  her  looking  strained  and  as  near  plain  as  anyone  with  her  looks  was  going  to\n",
      "Her  profile  was  very  sharp  against  the  gathering  darkness\n",
      "What  is  it love he  asked anxiously falling  into  a  term  of  his  childhood and  she  jumped\n",
      "Sorry I 'd  drifted  off\n",
      "I  was  wondering  about  Peter  Yeo\n",
      "Suppose  they  had  been  having  an  affair and  she 'd  dropped  him\n",
      "McLeish  considered  this\n",
      "When  she  met  Giles  Hawick\n",
      "Well that 's  possible is n't  it\n",
      "If  you  remember Hawick  said  and  he 's  not  silly  that  there  was  someone  else  on  the  scene  when  he  first  asked  her  out\n",
      "Perhaps  it  was  Mr  Yeo\n",
      "And  she  decided  Hawick  was  the  better  bet particularly  since  he  was n't  married\n",
      "McLeish  pondered  this eyes  narrowed driving  fast  but  carefully\n",
      "Perhaps  there  is n't  all  that  much  fun  in  going  around  with  a  married  bloke after  all\n",
      "She  could  still  have  wanted  him  but  got  tired  of  waiting  decided  he  was n't  going  to  leave  his  wife\n",
      "Catherine  was  sounding  tough  and  rational but  something  in  her  voice  made  him  feel  this  whole  discussion  was  uncomfortable  for  her\n",
      "He  sneaked  a  look  at  her and  found  he  had  an  excellent  view  of  the  back  of  her  head she  was  staring  out  of  the  passenger  window  at  the  darkening  vista  of  St  James 's  Park\n",
      "He  looked  again cautiously and  saw  that  she  was  blindly  extracting  a  crumpled  paper  handkerchief  from  her  neat  navy  bag\n",
      "He  waited  thirty  seconds  before  glancing  sideways  again and  found  her  dabbing  at  her  face trying  hard  not  to  sniff\n",
      "He  flicked  up  the  left-hand  indicator  and  stopped  the  car\n",
      "I  need  some  tea  and  I 've  got  a  thermos  here he  announced getting  out  of  the  car  without  looking  at  her  and  opening  the  back  door  on  his  side  to  find  the  thermos  which  he  had  filled  before  starting  off\n",
      "He  got  the  top  off  and  a  cup  poured  before  lowering  himself  gingerly  back  into  the  driving  seat  and  passing  it  over  to  Catherine\n",
      "Then  he  glanced  quickly  at  her\n",
      "It  was  nearly  dark  outside  but  the  dashboard  lights  cast  a  faint  greenish  glow\n",
      "She  was  still  sitting  with  her  head  partly  averted so  her  face  was  hidden\n",
      "He  poured  himself  a  cup  of  tea  and  drank  it selfconsciously very  aware  of  her  sitting  tensely  beside  him\n",
      "Thank  you John\n",
      "That  was  nice\n",
      "Catherine  sounded  suddenly  exhausted and  as  she  gave  him  back  the  cup  she  turned  towards  him letting  him  see  that  she  had  been  crying but  without  looking  him  in  the  face\n",
      "Looking  down  at  the  curve  of  her  cheekbone still  wet  with  tears he  suddenly  wanted  her quite  overwhelmingly\n",
      "He  sat  frozen  in  his  seat  by  surprise so  blocked  by  his  own  consideration  of  duty honour  and  the  right  way  to  behave  to  junior  staff  that  in  the  end  it  was  she  who  moved  towards  him and  touched  his  cheek\n",
      "He  slid  his  cheek  against  hers  and moving  with  delicious  deliberate  slowness he  kissed  her  on  the  lips\n",
      "The  sheer  pleasure  of  it  swept  him  up  and  it  was  a  full  minute  before  he  pulled  back  and  looked  at  her amazed  at  how  happy  he  felt\n",
      "Jesus Catherine\n",
      "Another  minute  and  I 'll  be  inviting  you  into  the  back  of  the  car\n",
      "He  watched  her  smile happy  and  comfortable  with  him secure  in  the  pleasure  they  shared\n",
      "If  you  like or  we  could  go  back  to  my  flat\n",
      "For  McLeish  the  rest  of  the  journey  had  the  quality  of  a  dream\n",
      "With  one  part  of  his  mind  he  knew  he  was  getting  the  benefit  of  the  backlash  from  an  experience  in  Catherine 's  past but  with  another  part  he  did n't  care  about  any  of  that there  was  no  reality  beyond  her\n",
      "The  feeling  of  dream-like  ease  persisted  when  they  arrived  at  Catherine 's  flat\n",
      "He  opened  the  car  door  for  her hugged  her  as  she  got  out and  they  went  up  to  her  flat his  arm  round  her  shoulders\n",
      "He  took  off  her  clothes  for  her while  she  undid  as  many  of  his  buttons  as  she  could and  after  that  it  was  pure undiluted uncomplicated  pleasure  until  they  fell  asleep  in  each  other  's  arms\n",
      "Either  Bruce  Davidson  always  sounded  like  a  Speak  Your  Weight  machine  when  he  was  delivering  a  prepared  statement or  the  answer-phone  stripped  all  character  from  People 's  voices\n",
      "McLeish  had  rung  his  own  flat  to  collect  messages he  could  see  Catherine  just  waking and  waved  to  her  to  indicate  that  he  was  on  the  phone\n",
      "He  realized  that  he  was  getting  cold clad  as  he  was  exclusively  in  a  rather  small  towel but  decided  to  stick  it  out  and  pick  up  all  of  Davidson 's  message\n",
      "There  were  two  key  pieces\n",
      "The  first  was  the  news  from  Cambridge the  samples  of  blood  and  hair  collected  by  his  long-suffering  team  were  confirmed  as  a  match  to  the  dead  girl 's\n",
      "The  indentation  in  her  skull  also  matched\n",
      "She  had  either  fallen  or  been  pushed  on  to  a  spike  on  the  plough the  level  of  her  blood  alcohol  gave  some  credence  to  the  idea  that  she  had  fallen\n",
      "The  doctor  who  had  done  the  autopsy however had  scouted promptly any  suggestion   that  she  could  have  moved  thereafter\n",
      "She  had  died  instantaneously or  pretty  nearly  so without  first  getting  up  and  crawling  down  the  embankment or  for  that  matter  getting  up  and  riding  a  bicycle\n",
      "Someone  had  thus  moved  the  body and  it  had  to  be  assumed  that  it  was  the  same  person  who  had  pushed  her  on  to  the  plough\n",
      "Doc  says  the  best  bet given  the  mark  on  her  cheek  is  that  someone  slapped  her  one  and  she  fell  back\n",
      "He 'll  put  it  in  writing  tomorrow Davidson  summarized  succinctly\n",
      "The  second  key  piece  of  information  was  that  Angela  Morgan 's  car  had  been  found  in  North  Kensington not  far  from  her  flat and  was  now  cordoned  off  and  being  crawled  over  inch  by  inch  by  a  forensic  team  hastily  dispatched  by  Davidson\n",
      "Did  McLeish  want  to  come  and  see  it in  situ  because  they  would  have  to  move  it  when  Forensic  had  finished\n",
      "A  detailed  inventory  of  Bruce 's  day  followed and  McLeish  understood  that  having  Catherine  Crane  working  on  this  case  had  rattled  Bruce  in  several  ways\n",
      "Right  at  the  end as  McLeish 's  teeth  were  starting  to  chatter Davidson  confirmed  that  Penelope  Huntley  would  meet  him  at  eight  next  morning  and  he  hoped  that  that  was n't  too  early sorry but  the  lass  had  been  difficult  to  tie  down  to  a  time\n",
      "McLeish  glanced  again  at  his  watch  eleven-thirty  p.m\n",
      "Just  as  well  someone  had  rung  Catherine  half  an  hour  ago or  they 'd  both  still  have  been  asleep and  he  would  have  had  difficult  questions  to  answer  in  the  morning  about  why  he  had  been uncharacteristically out  of  touch  with  everyone  since  leaving  Yeo  Davis  at  six\n",
      "He  rang  Davidson  to  confirm  that  he  could  make  the  eight  a.  m.  appointment\n",
      "We  have  a  date  at  eight  o'clock he  said  redundantly  to  Catherine\n",
      "I  heard\n",
      "I 've  put  the  heating  on\n",
      "Why  do n't  you  have  a  bath you 're  cold\n",
      "I  d  like  that\n",
      "They 've  found  her  car too  I 'll  have  to  go  and  look  at  it  before  they  take  it  away\n",
      "I 'll  come  with  you\n",
      "He  hesitated\n",
      "Nothing  I 'd  like  better\n",
      "But  they 're  all   going  to  wonder  why  I  dragged  you  along  at  this  time  of  night\n",
      "I  mean what  have  we  been  doing\n",
      "Catherine  looked  downcast and  McLeish  felt  uneasy\n",
      "Sweet it 's  you  I 'm  trying  to  protect\n",
      "And  yourself\n",
      "McLeish  acknowledged  the  point  promptly\n",
      "Both  of  us  need  protecting\n",
      "Old  Stevenson  would  go  spare  if  he  knew and  I 'm  not  certain  whether  he 'd  try  and  get  me  moved  as  a  danger  to  junior  staff or  you  moved  as  a  wicked  woman\n",
      "But  he 'd  shift  one  of  us\n",
      "His  staff  do  not  have  private  lives  and  certainly  not  with  each  other\n",
      "She  looked  at  him  carefully wrapped  in  a  sheet with  her  blond  curly  hair  ruffled she  looked  like  an  advertisement  for  almost  anything\n",
      "Sorry you 're  right she  said\n",
      "It  would  be  me  he 'd  try  and  shift too\n",
      "He 's  not  got  much  of  a  reputation  as  a  feminist\n",
      "The  Met 's  a  bit  short  of  those McLeish  agreed\n",
      "Look you  get  some  sleep\n",
      "I 'll  go  and  see  the  car  and  get  back  to  my  flat and  I 'll  pick  you  up  at  seven-thirty  tomorrow\n",
      "All  right\n",
      "You 'd  like  to  get  home\n",
      "She  was  perfectly  secure  in  her  own  attractions  and  amused and  McLeish  was  disconcerted\n",
      "No I  mean no\n",
      "I  just  thought  you  would n't  want  to  be  woken  up  again\n",
      "I  do n't  mind  being  woken  up\n",
      "He  found  himself  avoiding  the  street  in  which  Francesca  lived  as  he  drove  for  North  Kensington calling  ahead  on  his  car  phone  to  make  sure  that  the  forensic  team  was  still  there\n",
      "He  arrived  to  find  them  just  finishing  and  asked  hopefully  if  any  prints  had  been  found\n",
      "No  prints  on  the  steering-wheel  or  any  of  the  doors\n",
      "Somebody 's  been  over  it  with  a  duster\n",
      "They  probably  wore  gloves too\n",
      "We 've  got  some  smudges  but  that 's  not  a  lot  of  use\n",
      "McLeish  left  them  to  it  and  walked  away  to  consider  exactly  where  he  was\n",
      "It  was  a  cul-de-sac  off  Ladbroke  Grove with  two  restaurants  and  two  large  pubs  at  the  top  of  it\n",
      "The  pub  was  orthodoxly  darkened  and  shuttered but   a  few  diners  were  still  left  in  the  restaurants\n",
      "It  was  a  road  on  the  way  up this  Malplaquet  Terrace as  McLeish a  Londoner  by  adoption observed\n",
      "The  two  large  pubs the  little  Indian  grocer and  the  shabby  peeling  premises  which  offered  dry-cleaning  were  relics  of  an  earlier  era but  both  restaurants on  the  other  hand were  new  and  forbiddingly  smart\n",
      "One  was  Italian one  French both  were  separated  from  the  street  by  extensive  terraces  and  were  distinctly  expensive\n",
      "He  peered  at  the  menu  displayed  with  accompanying  admiring  press  comment  outside  the  Trattoria  San  Giorgio and  decided  you 'd  be  lucky  to  get  out  of  there  under  £20  a  head\n",
      "La  Bretagne  looked  even  pricier\n",
      "Next  to  these  was  a  small  antique  shop window  lights  on  even  at  this  hour displaying  elegant  white  china  dogs  and  small  pieces  of  Victorian  furniture and  next  to  that  an  estate  agent\n",
      "It  would  only  be  a  matter  of  ti  me  before  the  pubs the  little  grocer  and  the  dry-cleaner 's  were  replaced  by  some  establishment  selling  something  on  which  an  enormous  mark-up  could  be  obtained\n",
      "As  he  walked  back  down  the  cul-de-sac  McLeish  found  a  demarcation  line so  precise  it  might  have  been  achieved  by  running  a  tape  across  the  road where  the  commercial  element  stopped  and  flat-fronted early  Victorian  terraced  houses took  over\n",
      "Further  down  yet the  terracing  ceased  and  became  pairs  of  large  semi-detached  houses  set  well  back  from  the  road  with  the  front  gardens  mostly  paved  and  dedicated  to  parking  space\n",
      "It  was  possible  to  see  the  same  sort  of  divide  as  at  the  commercial  end every  second  house  had  been  restored  and  repainted with  extensions  sprouting  in  the  gaps  between  them\n",
      "Most  of  the  others  seemed  to  be  in  the  process  of  renovation\n",
      "McLeish  counted out  of  interest ten  separate  sets  of  scaffolding\n",
      "People  would  still  be  living  here  who  had  been  in  residence  since  before  the  war  and  were  holding  on  to  controlled  tenancies  until  dislodged  by  offers  of  cash  or  other  accommodation but  they  would  not  be  there  much  longer\n",
      "He  had  arrived  back  beside  Angela  Morgan 's  car and  stopped  to  contemplate  it\n",
      "A  blue  BMW neat  but  not  gaudy not  souped-up but  a  fast useful  car\n",
      "On  her  money  she  could  well  have  afforded  something  grander like  a   Porsche but  evidently  she  had  decided  against  ostentation\n",
      "It  was  the  sort  of  car  that  a  successful  young  man  bought  for  himself not  a  woman 's  car  in  the  generally  used  sense  of  the  phrase nor  a  car  that  a  man  would  choose  for  a  woman\n",
      "It  was  neither  the  sensible  shopping-basket  that  men  bought  for  their  wives nor  the  flashy  jobs  rich  men  bought  for  their  mistresses\n",
      "He  looked  at  the  number  plate  and  realized  that  he  had  found  the  sole  piece  of  ostentation  Miss  Morgan  had  allowed  herself she  had  been  Angela  Jane  Morgan  and  the  car  was  AJM  563\n",
      "She  must  have  had  to  pay  a  bit  for  that\n",
      "The  car  was  parked  neatly  between  two  patches  of  off-street  parking in  one  of  the  very  few  parts  of  the  street  that  was  neither  metered  nor  dedicated  to  residents '  parking\n",
      "Not  put  here  by  chance  then someone  had  known  this  street\n",
      "Assuming  the  car  had  gone  missing  at  the  same  ti  me  as  Angela  Morgan it  might  have  been  there  for  over  a  week it  had  only  been  found  that  evening  by  a  uniformed  constable  who  was  keeping  his  eyes  open\n",
      "Evidently people  in  this  street  were  used  to  strange  cars  being  parked  and  nobody  had  thought  it  worth  while  to  ring  the  police despite  the  fact  that  the  doors  bristled  with  Neighbourhood  Watch  signs\n",
      "Perhaps  the  car  had  not  actually  been  there  since  Angela  Morgan  disappeared but  that  seemed  unlikely\n",
      "He  asked  the  forensic  team  leader  for  his  views  and  the  man  shook  his  head\n",
      "I  would  think  it 's  been  here  for  several  days sir\n",
      "It 's  covered  with  dust  and  the  road 's  dry  underneath although  we 've  had  a  lot  of  rain\n",
      "Anything  useful\n",
      "We 've  got  some  tiny  samples  from  the  tyres\n",
      "It 's  been  in  the  mud  somewhere\n",
      "We 'll  compare  it  with  what  we  took  up  at  the  site\n",
      "Could  be  the  murderer  used  this  car\n",
      "He  cleaned  it  first then before  dumping  it sir\n",
      "Nothing  on  it just  a  few  smudges\n",
      "Probably  put  it  through  a  car-wash\n",
      "The  inside  has  been  vacuumed  recently too\n",
      "We 're  not  getting  much  here apart  from  the  samples  off  the  tyres We 'll  take  it  apart  when  we  get  it  away  from  here of  course\n",
      "Both  men  stood  aside  to  let  a  big  dark-green  Jaguar  edge  carefully  round  them  on  to  the  forecourt  of  the  house  immediately  to  the  left  of  where  the  BMW  was  parked\n",
      "A  small  bouncy  couple  in  their  fifties  got  out staring  at  the  lights  and  the  screens  round  Angela  Morgan 's  car and  came  over  to  them  with  all  the  confidence  of  the  middle-class  member  of  a  Neighbourhood  Watch  scheme\n",
      "Can  I  help\n",
      "That  car 's  been  parked  there  over  a  week and  I  was  just  beginning  to  wonder  about  ringing  the  police\n",
      "Lots  of  people  from  the  restaurants  park  down  here  in  the  evening but  I  only  just  realized talking  to  my  wife that  it  had  actually  been  there  all  day  as  well\n",
      "Stolen  car is  it\n",
      "McLeish tired  as  he  was fell  promptly  on  this  witness  and  accepted  an  invitation  to  coffee\n",
      "The  Masters  had  been  out  to  dinner  and  were  well  mellowed wide  awake  and  disposed  to  chat but  sitting  in  their  quarry-tiled  kitchen-diner with  thousands  of  pounds '  worth  of  elegant  cabinet  work  and  expensive  machinery  around  him McLeish  managed  to  extract  a  coherent  story\n",
      "Mr  Masters  was  quite  clear  that  he  had  first  seen  the  blue  BMW  late  on  the  Saturday  evening ten  days  before pointing  out  that while  you  could n't  exactly  complain it  had  made  access  to  his  own  forecourt  space  a  little  difficult or  at  least  when  there  was  already  another  car  on  the  forecourt which  there  mostly  was that  being  Mrs  Masters 's  runabout\n",
      "He  was  sure  it  had  been  there  every  night  since and  Mrs  Masters  turned  out  to  be  equally  confident  that  it  had  also  been  there  during  the  day\n",
      "They  had  looked  at  each  other disconcerted  at  this  apparent  lack  of  liaison but  McLeish  had  been  reassuring very  natural  that  they  had n't  compared  notes extremely  useful  that  he  now  knew  how  long  the  car  had  been  there\n",
      "Was  it  stolen Chief  Inspector\n",
      "I  mean do  chief  inspectors  look  at  stolen  cars\n",
      "We 've  never  seen  much  above  a  detective  sergeant  in  the  road  before\n",
      "Mr  Masters mellow  or  not had  gathered  his  wits\n",
      "He  was  a  small  bright-eyed balding active  man interested  in  everything  around  him\n",
      "Not  necessarily\n",
      "We 've  been  looking  for  this  car  as  part   of  a  murder  investigation\n",
      "It  belonged  to  a  Miss  Angela  Morgan and  you  may  have  seen  the  death  reported\n",
      "What 's  the  matter  with  me\n",
      "Mr  Masters  enquired smiting  himself  on  the  forehead\n",
      "I  saw  it  in  the  papers I  even  noticed  that  the  car  was  missing and  it  was  a  BMW\n",
      "I  just  did n't  put  it  together\n",
      "You  would  have sooner  or  later McLeish  said liking  the  man\n",
      "That 's  what  happens something  ticks  away  in  your  mind  and  you  suddenly  realize  there 's  a  connection\n",
      "We 'll  have  to  send  people  round  all  the  houses  in  the  street see  if  anyone  saw  the  person  who  left  the  car  here\n",
      "Could  have  been  the  girl  herself\n",
      "Yes possibly\n",
      "McLeish  decided  not  to  expand and  rose  to  go conscious  that  it  was  one-thirty  a.m\n",
      "And  that  he  had  an  interview  at  eight  in  the  morning\n",
      "He  found  at  the  edge  of  his  consciousness  the  wish  that  he  was  just  going  to  his  own  flat  to  crash  out  rather  than  back  to  share  Catherine 's  warm  bed\n",
      "At  eight  a.m.  it  was  pouring  with  rain and  very  cold as  the  partners  of  Yeo  Davis  straggled  in  through  the  neat  entrance their  footsteps  echoing  on  the  tiles\n",
      "It  was  far  too  early  for  the  immaculate  and  highly  paid  receptionist  to  be  in in  fact no  one  below  the  level  of  partner  was  present\n",
      "Peter  Yeo accustomed  to  leading  from  the  front had  arrived  at  seven-thirty  and  personally  made  the  coffee  and  brought  in  croissants so  that  the  reassuring  presence  of  food  greeted  the  other  three  partners\n",
      "Sorry  to  get  you  here  so  early he  said but  Angela 's  death  means  we  have  to  reorganize  the  entire  workload and  I  wanted  a  longer  meeting  today\n",
      "There 's  a  lot  going  on\n",
      "Tim I 'd  like  you  to  report  on  administrative  matters  first to  get  that  out  of  the  way\n",
      "Tim  Reagan a  gaunt  forty-year-old who  was  a  genius  with  trade  unions  as  well  as  being  an  accountant  and  Peter  Yeo 's  right  hand moved  swiftly  through  the  secretarial  problem which  was  one  of  shortage  of  same and  seemed as  Peter  Yeo  observed  pleasantly to  have  been  exactly  the   same  difficulty  any  time  in  the  last  two  years to  a  discussion  of  building  security in  which  no  one  was  much  interested  either\n",
      "The  next  problem  is  fees Tim  said noticing  sardonically  that  his  partners '  level  of  attention  rose  sharply\n",
      "As  you  all  know we  billed  £400,000  for  our  success  fee  to  Regina  Securities  a  good  eleven  months  ago  they  were  one  of  Richard 's  clients\n",
      "He  paused  and  the  meeting  observed  a  thirty-second  silence  in  honour  of  Richard  Fairley  who  had  left  the  partnership  a  year  previously  for  considerably  more  than  a  handful  of  silver taking  with  him  Regina  Securities '  main  reason  for  being  interested  in  paying  Yeo  Davis 's  bills\n",
      "I 've  written Peter 's  written the  solicitors  have  written\n",
      "Absolutely  nothing  has  happened\n",
      "We  need  to  decide  whether  to  put  in  a  writ  or  what\n",
      "Have  we  tried  lunch the  next  most  senior  partner  enquired  hopefully invoking  what  all  felt  to  be  the  partnership 's  most  powerful  weapon\n",
      "Oh  God yes\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  roused  himself\n",
      "Brady  and  I  lunched and  we 've  talked  several  times\n",
      "He 's  been  all  sweetness  and  light promised  nothing  and  done  ditto\n",
      "Do  we  have  to  sue the  questioner  pressed unhappily and  Tim  Reagan  considered  him  wearily\n",
      "Mike that  £400,000  sits  in  our  last  year 's  accounts  as  an  asset  a  debt  someone  owes  us\n",
      "It 's  in  this  year 's  draft  accounts  too but  we  have  people  called  auditors  who  are  going  to  recognize  this  bill and  ask  all  sorts  of  boring  questions  like  why  it  has  not  been  paid whether  it  is  likely  to  be  paid and  if  so  when\n",
      "And  if  we  ca n't  produce  some  pretty  credible  answers  then  they  wo n't  allow  that  £400,000  to  sit  in  the  accounts  at  the  full  value\n",
      "Either  we 'll  have  to  take  a  very  heavy  discount  on  it or  we 'll  get  our  accounts  qualified\n",
      "The  other  even  more  pressing  reason  is  that  we  need  the  cash we 're  running  an  overdraft  and  that 's  not  funny  with  these  interest  rates\n",
      "Peter  Yeo who  had  been  watching  his  partners realized  that  he  and  Tim  were  not  carrying  the  other  two  and  decided  to  make  another  effort\n",
      "The  reason  the  auditors  will  give  us  trouble Mike is   that  they  have  to  certify  that  our  accounts  give  a  true  and  fair  account  of  the  financial  state  of  the  business\n",
      "And  if  we  have  £400,000  in  there  which  is n't  really  £400,000 then  the  accounts  do n't  tell  you  what 's  going  on\n",
      "He  watched  grimly  as  Mike  Laister easily  the  best  man  with  any  drinks  company grasped  the  point\n",
      "The  business  is n't  worth  what  we  thought  it  was that 's  what  you 're  saying\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Tim  Reagan  was  obviously  relieved\n",
      "Or  it  may  not  be but  we  wo n't  know  till  we  sue  them\n",
      "It 'll  take  a  long  time  in  the  courts wo n't  it though\n",
      "Mike  Laister  was  still  clinging  to  his  point  of  view\n",
      "What  we  hope  is  that  a  writ  will  make  them  settle Mike at  some  level\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  sounded  soothing\n",
      "It 'd  better Tim  Reagan  said\n",
      "The  administrators  of  Angela 's  estate  are  going  to  ask  for  her  £100,000  back\n",
      "They 're  not  going  to  get  it  till  the  end  of  the  notice  period which  is  twelve  months but  we  need  the  cash\n",
      "And  we  are  behind  with  tax\n",
      "We 've  got  more  than  enough  time  to  worry  about  that  Tim and  I 'm  sure  the  bank  will  cover  us\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  spoke  hastily\n",
      "But  do  we  now  all  agree  that  we  should  issue  a  writ  against  Regina\n",
      "I  honestly  do n't  believe  there  is  any  alternative\n",
      "His  partners brought  to  the  sticking  point agreed somewhat  reproachfully and  passed  on  firmly  to  the  question  of  who  was  going  to  take  over  which  of  Angela 's  clients\n",
      "I  will  of  course  remain  responsible  for  Barton since  I  know  Andy  well Peter  Yeo  said firmly\n",
      "But  I 'll  need  some  support  if  I  am  to  give  him  the  service  he  wants\n",
      "Angela  was  doing  a  very  good  job  there taking  him  round  the  MPs  he  had  to  talk  to\n",
      "Tim  Reagan  stirred\n",
      "I  did  say  to  her  that  the  man  Andy  should  see  was  Giles  Hawick  himself\n",
      "It  will  in  the  end  be  a  Treasury  concern and  if  the  DTI  is  really  going  to  be  allowed  to  spend  millions  propping  up  Huerter now  that  it 's  a  different  government it 's  very  much  in  Hawick 's  area\n",
      "Maybe  she  felt  it  was  too  awkward\n",
      "Or  maybe  she   felt  she  could  do  the  briefing  personally as  it  were\n",
      "Did  she  do  anything  about  that\n",
      "He  observed  with  interest  that  his  partner  Peter  Yeo  was  looking  extremely  uncomfortable\n",
      "She  would  have of  course but  I  do n't  know  if  she  did\n",
      "He  considered scratching  the  side  of  his  jaw\n",
      "It 's  a  good  point though Tim thank  you\n",
      "I 'll  see  what  I  can  do  with  it\n",
      "There 's  a  lot  of  work  to  do  on  that  case  can  I  have  Susy  Harvey  to  assist\n",
      "Two  of  his  partners  protested  promptly  that  the  said  Susy  was  fully  deployed  on  their  cases and  Peter  Yeo  settled  down  to  reorganize  the  workload emerging  after  ten  minutes '  hard  negotiation  with  more  or  less  the  conclusion  he  had  wanted\n",
      "I  ca n't  do  that  thing  on  Saturday  he  said  apologetically  to  Tim  Reagan who having  sacrificed  one  of  his  staff  in  the  arrangement was  mildly  suggesting  a  reciprocal  deal\n",
      "I 've  promised  to  take  Claudia  away  for  the  weekend and  she 's  not  going  to  let  me  off  it  even  though  we 're  so  shorthanded\n",
      "Ca n't  blame  her really there 's  never  any  time\n",
      "Tim  Reagan who  would  not  have  dared  to  give  his  French  wife  as  little  time  as  Claudia  Yeo  got murmured  that  this  was  of  course  important  and  good  luck  to  them indeed\n",
      "Something  else  I  wanted  to  mention Peter he  went  on\n",
      "If  it  turns  out  that  £400,000  really  is n't  there then  perhaps  we  charged  Angela  too  much  for  her  partnership  share\n",
      "We  were  acting  in  good  faith of  course and  I  ca n't  imagine  that  anyone  is  going  to  be  difficult  now  she  is  gone\n",
      "Just  thought  I 'd  mention  it  the  auditors  may  say  something  like  it\n",
      "Let  them Peter  Yeo  said angrily\n",
      "Angie  had  nothing  to  complain  about  anyone  would  have  been  glad  to  put  up  £100,000  to  get  in  here\n",
      "That  Regina  fee  is  just  a  blip  we 're  on  to  a  £500,000  success  fee  from  Barton and  we 'll  get  that\n",
      "Tim  Reagan  raised  his  hands  in  mock  submission surprised  by  his  partner 's  vehemence and  followed  him  out  of  the  door\n",
      "In  the  hall  sat  Claudia  Yeo  herself evidently  waiting  for   her  husband and  Tim  stopped  to  say  hello  to  her\n",
      "She  looked  as  if  she  needed  that  weekend  away\n",
      "She  was  overweight overtired distinctly  anxious her  hair  was  untidy and  both  her  suit  and  her  shoes  were  in  need  of  a  clean\n",
      "Not  what  one  expected  of  the  wife  of  the  senior  partner Tim  observed thinking  smugly  of  his  own  immaculately  turned-out  Patrice who  would  refuse  to  eat  if  she  put  on  even  an  extra  pound  and  who  would  as  soon  leave  the  house  naked  as  without  make-up\n",
      "Oh Peter there  you  are\n",
      "His  senior  partner  was  not  at  all  ravished  by  this  incursion  into  his  working  day Tim  observed  maliciously as  he  faded  tactfully  away\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  bustled  his  wife  into  his  office  calling  automatically  for  coffee\n",
      "Claudia I 've  got  a  meeting  in  ten  minutes then  I 'm  booked  solid  through  the  day\n",
      "What  is  it\n",
      "Can  it  not  wait  till  tonight\n",
      "What  do  you  mean tonight\n",
      "Eleven-thirty  or  later as  usual\n",
      "Perhaps  I  ought  to  ring  Dawn  and  make  an  appointment  if  I  want  to  talk  to  you\n",
      "You  never  see  the  children  either\n",
      "They  glared  at  each  other  across  the  table two  people  in  early  middle  age  who  had  had  the  same  quarrel  in  the  same  words  many  times\n",
      "By  mutual  consent  they  desisted and  Peter  Yeo  took  a  deep  breath\n",
      "Sorry he  said grimly\n",
      "What  is  the  problem\n",
      "I 've  had  the  police  round asking  about  Angela\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  breathed  deep  in  exasperation\n",
      "Type  of  police\n",
      "Bobby  in  a  helmet  with  a  notebook was  it\n",
      "Claudia  considered  him  with  open  dislike  and  lit  a  cigarette  deliberately\n",
      "No dear a  CID  sergeant  from  Scotland  Yard\n",
      "A  Scot\n",
      "I  asked  to  see  his  identification\n",
      "And  his  assistant 's\n",
      "I 'll  find  you  an  ashtray\n",
      "Do n't  put  it  in  the  saucer Claudia for  God 's  sake\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  felt  a  headache  starting and  felt  the  familiar  pressure  just  above  the  right  eye  worsen  with  the  realization  that  in  precisely  five  minutes  he  would  be  needed  in  a  meeting\n",
      "What  did  he  want  to  know\n",
      "She  did n't  answer  immediately  but  looked  down  at  the   table then  up  at  him\n",
      "When  I  come  to  think  about  it  afterwards I  do n't  know  quite  what  he  was  after\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  controlled  the  impulse  to  shout  at  her realizing  that  his  wife  was  badly  rattled\n",
      "She  might  exasperate  him but  she  was  fully  as  intelligent  as  he  was  and  it  would  be  as  well  to  get  to  the  bottom  of  this\n",
      "Did  he  say  why  he  had  come  to  see  you\n",
      "He  had  a  perfectly  good  reason\n",
      "They  had  checked  Angela 's  diary  for  the  two  weeks  before  she  had  gone  missing  and  were  talking  to  everyone  in  it\n",
      "Including  the  clients peter  Yeo  sat  bolt  upright appalled\n",
      "Oh  God\n",
      "Well I  suppose  so\n",
      "They  stared  at  each  other momentarily  united  in  recognition  of  the  difficulties\n",
      "I 'll  call  them  all personally\n",
      "Yeo  jabbed  a  finger  on  a  button  on  his  phone\n",
      "Dawn please  get  Angela 's  diary  for  the  two  weeks  before  she  went  missing  and  last  week  and  list  every  date  she  had\n",
      "Now please in  the  next  ten  minutes\n",
      "Sorry but  this  is  a  crisis\n",
      "He  returned  his  attention  to  his  wife\n",
      "I  did n't  realize  you  had  seen  Angie  quite  recently\n",
      "We  had  a  drink  together\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  rose  abruptly  and  went  to  straighten  a  picture  on  the  wall  opposite  him his  wife  watching  him  warily\n",
      "Why he  asked  over  his  shoulder\n",
      "I  did n't  think  you  were  all  that  friendly\n",
      "Claudia  Yeo  closed  her  eyes  and  forced  herself  to  speak  to  the  empty  space  behind  the  desk\n",
      "I  suppose  I  wanted  to  make  sure  she  was  going  to  marry  Giles  Hawick\n",
      "She  dragged  on  her  cigarette listening  for  any  movement  from  her  husband  behind  her and  jumped  as  he  walked  round  to  stare  out  of  a  window\n",
      "And  she  said  she  was he  asked into  the  silence\n",
      "Yes she  did\n",
      "But  she  also  said  Hawick  wanted  her  to  give  up  her  partnership  here  and  she  did n't  think  she  could  bear  to\n",
      "She 'd  have  talked  him  round surely\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  was  still  looking  out  of  the  window and  Claudia  glanced  at  his   familiar  back too  short  and  too  broad  despite  the  most  expensive  tailoring with  real  anxiety You  do n't  honestly  think  that do  you Peter\n",
      "People  like  Giles  Hawick  do n't  get  talked  round\n",
      "He  turned and  they  regarded  each  other  steadily  across  the  room\n",
      "She  was  definitely  going  to  marry  him\n",
      "And  I  suppose  we  might  have  lost  her  in  the  long  run but  not  just  yet\n",
      "Claudia  Yeo  nerved  herself  for  a  final  effort\n",
      "And  you 'd  really  accepted  that  they  would  marry\n",
      "He  hesitated then  became  angry\n",
      "Of  course  I  had Claudia what  do  you  mean\n",
      "I  know  you  two  were  very  close as  the  papers  say\n",
      "Claudia  Yeo  was  feeling  sick but  knew  she  was  on  secure  ground\n",
      "I  hoped  that  she  had  really  decided  to  go  for  Giles  Hawick  instead\n",
      "Peter  Yeo  opened  his  mouth  to  speak and  found  nothing  useful  to  say\n",
      "I  did n't  tell  the  police  any  of  this of  course she  said\n",
      "I  just  said  that  I  was  having  a  drink  with  her  to  ask  her  what  she  would  really  like  as  a  wedding  present  from  the  firm because  men  are  no  good  at  that  sort  of  thing\n",
      "She  paused  and  looked  at  him  sidelong\n",
      "I  thought  that  was  rather  clever\n",
      "Peter  Yeo 's  mouth  quirked  involuntarily\n",
      "He  reached  for  Claudia 's  hand  and  held  it looking  steadily  into  her  face\n",
      "She  was  a  good  mate  and  a  very  able ambitious  girl\n",
      "I 'm  not  sure  Hawick  was  right  for  her  and  I 'd  have  been  sorry  to  lose  her but  that 's  beside  the  point\n",
      "She  was  going  to  marry  him\n",
      "She  tightened  her  hand  on  his and  they  sat  holding  hands  for  half  a  minute  before  Peter  Yeo  caught  sight  of  his  watch\n",
      "Darling I  must  get  on\n",
      "We  are  in  chaos  here  until  we  get  all  Angela 's  work  redistributed we 're  all  of  us  doing  five  things  at  once\n",
      "Thank  you  for  coming  to  talk  to  me and  why  do n't  you  come  with  me  to  this  thing  this  evening\n",
      "It 's  not  a  riot  of  pleasure but  we 'd  be  there  together\n",
      "She  returned  his  kiss but  declined  firmly  to  join  him  at   the  Allied  Steelmakers '  annual  dinner  carriages  eleven-thirty saying  she  would  actually  rather  go  to  the  cinema  with  a  girlfriend and  tripped  out  of  the  office  looking  considerably  less  harassed  than  when  she  had  arrived\n",
      "At  New  Scotland  Yard John  McLeish  was  spitting  feathers as  one  of  his  staff  graphically  put  it\n",
      "He  had  arrived pale  and  markedly  short  of  sleep at  seven-fifty  and  at  eight-thirty  had  rung  Penelope  Huntley 's  flat  to  find  her  barely  awake bad-tempered vague  and  professing  not  to  have  made  an  appointment  at  all\n",
      "Furious  but  civil he  had  offered  to  go  round  to  her  flat  to  see  her an  offer  which  she  had  declined  with  the  first  sign  of  decisiveness  she  had  been  heard  to  display\n",
      "She  had  offered  to  be  at  New  Scotland  Yard  by  nine-thirty  and  it  was  now  nine  forty-five\n",
      "She 's  playing  hard  to  get is n't  she John\n",
      "Bruce  Davidson  suggested\n",
      "She  agreed  eight  o'clock  when  I  spoke  to  her  yesterday after  I 'd  offered  her  every  other  hour  of  the  day\n",
      "She 's  a  nutter maybe there 's  always  one  in  a  case\n",
      "Mm\n",
      "McLeish  decided  to  get  some  work  in\n",
      "Tell  me  about  Mrs  Yeo\n",
      "Was  her  husband  playing  around\n",
      "I 'd  say  so\n",
      "She 's  a  good-looking  woman but  she 's  jumpy  and  she  does'na  have  the  confidence\n",
      "Let  herself  go  a  bit ye  get  that  with  women  whose  men  are  giving  them  a  hard  time and  who  hav'na  found  a  way  of  getting  their  retaliation  in  first\n",
      "McLeish  considered  his  local  expert  on  women  narrowly\n",
      "It 's  not  evidence\n",
      "You  didna  ask  me  for  evidence John you  sought  my  best  judgement and  you  have  it\n",
      "I 'd  have  been  glad  to  give  a  wee  helping  hand  there  myself and  I 'm  sure  one  was  needed\n",
      "Some  of  it  was  instinct  with  Davidson of  course but  most  of  it  was  solid  experience starting as  Davidson  had  once  told  him with  his  being  seduced  by  the  school-dinner  lady  at  the  age  of  thirteen  in  his  native  Ayrshire\n",
      "Och  well John there 's  not  a  lot  else  to  do  up  there  in  winter he  had   observed radically  changing  McLeish 's  views  of  the  activities  available  to  schoolchildren  in  country  districts\n",
      "McLeish  reflected  uncomfortably  that  he  would  have  to  be  very  circumspect  in  his  dealings  with  Catherine with  this  beady-eyed  observer  around  the  place\n",
      "On  this  thought Catherine  put  her  head  in politely  excusing  herself  to  Bruce  Davidson and  said  that  Miss  Huntley  had  finally  got  here\n",
      "She  can  damn  well  wait  for  a  minute McLeish  decided\n",
      "Bruce why  did  the  good  Mrs  Yeo  want  to  have  a  drink  with  her  rival\n",
      "All  girls  together did  you  think\n",
      "No  hard  feelings darling so  nice  you 're  getting  married\n",
      "Bruce  Davidson  considered  his  notes\n",
      "She  said  to  me  that  the  partners  in  the  firm  couldna  decide  what  to  give  the  lass  for  her  wedding  and  had  asked  her as  wife  of  the  senior  partner to  have  a  wee  word\n",
      "It 's  possible John\n",
      "Yes it  is McLeish  conceded\n",
      "He  sighed\n",
      "We 'll  have  to  see  her  again Bruce  if  Yeo  was  having  it  off  with  Angela  Morgan both  he  and  his  missis  have  to  be  in  the  frame\n",
      "And  you  think  that 's  likely\n",
      "I  told  you  that  I  formed  the  impression  that  Mrs  Yeo  was  not  secure  in  her  husband 's  affections Davidson  said primly\n",
      "McLeish  grinned  at  him  and  told  Catherine  to  organize  Penelope  Huntley hoping  he  had  struck  the  right  brisk  note\n",
      "He  was  not  reassured  by  hearing  Bruce  Davidson  in  the  passage  cheerily  observing  to  Catherine  that  she  was  looking  a  bittie  pale was  it  just  the  London  air or  had  she  been  burning  the  candle  at  both  ends\n",
      "He  let  a  dignified  minute  pass  before  going  out  himself collecting  Catherine and  dispatching  Bruce  to  supervise  the  house-to-house  interviews  in  Malplaquet  Terrace to  see  if  anyone  could  be  found  who  had  seen  the  blue  BMW  arrive  or  caught  sight  of  its  driver\n",
      "McLeish  stopped  at  the  door  of  the  interview  room  and  looked  in  through  the  spy-hole wanting  to  get  some  feel  for  the  evidently  hostile  and by  all  accounts neurotic  Penelope  Huntley\n",
      "His  first  sight  of  her  was  reassuringly   normal a  tall dark  girl  dressed  in  a  good  grey  suit  of  the  type  favoured  by  Francesca which  acted  effectively  as  a  uniform  without  doing  much  for  her\n",
      "An  expensive  handbag  lay  on  the  table and  she  was  reading  the  morning  paper  in  a  perfectly  ordinary  way\n",
      "But  as  she  lifted  her  head  to  greet  them McLeish  decided  the  first  impression  had  been  false\n",
      "Her  hair  was  lank her  skin  blotchy  and  spotty\n",
      "She  was  evidently  a  heavy  smoker  for  the  first  two  fingers  of  her  right  hand  were  stained  with  nicotine and now  that  he  looked the  nails  were  bitten  and  the  cuticles  chewed  raw\n",
      "She  looked  as  if  she  had  just  got  out  of  bed and  McLeish  had  a  sudden  vision  of  a  dark  basement  flat  with  greasy  mugs  on  every  surface\n",
      "She  looked  both  wary  and  defiant well people  often  did faced  with  the  police but  it  was  an  unusual  combination  to  find  in  a  girl  from  the  confident  middle  class\n",
      "Is  it  not  warm  enough  in  here he  enquired  by  way  of  greeting seeing  her  clasping  her  jacket  round  her\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley  let  go  of  it  anxiously  and  said  no that  it  was  perfectly  fine she 'd  just  been  cold  outside\n",
      "McLeish  took  her  briskly  through  the  course making  the  now  familiar  speech  about  Angela  Morgan 's  death  being  treated  as  a  case  of  murder which  meant  taking  statements  from  everyone  who  had  been  associated  with  her  and  might  be  helpful\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley  sat  silent  through  this  speech chain-smoking her  eyes  downcast\n",
      "In  the  end  he  stopped  talking  and  watched  her  till  she  looked  at  him sideways  and  warily\n",
      "In  the  course  of  this  process  we  have  talked  to  Miss  Morgan 's  solicitor who  told  us  that  she  was  the  life  tenant  of  a  substantial  estate and  that  you  are  what  they  call  the  remainder-man\n",
      "That  is  the  correct  term yes\n",
      "It  was  my  Uncle  Bill 's  money\n",
      "Well that  woke  her  up McLeish  thought watching  the  restless  fingers\n",
      "The  sight  of  a  young  woman  alternately  smoking  her  head  off  and  chewing  her  cuticles  left  a  lot  to  be  desired\n",
      "I  understand  that  a  substantial  part  of  his  estate  was  left  to  Miss  Morgan he  enquired with  a  strong  feeling  of  throwing  petrol  on  to  a  fire\n",
      "Yes it  was\n",
      "We  both  got  legacies and  she  got  the  bulk  of  the  estate  for  her  lifetime\n",
      "She  was  his  mistress of  course although  she  was  over  thirty  years  younger  than  him\n",
      "She  ground  a  half-smoked  cigarette  into  the  ashtray and  McLeish  was  left  with  the  feeling  that  she  would  willingly  have  done  the  same  to  the  live  flesh  of  Angela  Morgan if  available\n",
      "How  do  you  feel  about  that\n",
      "Her  head  came  up  and  she  looked  him  in  the  eye\n",
      "Well it  was  his  money was n't  it and  I  was  only  his  niece\n",
      "I  was  disappointed  of  course but  I  got  over  it\n",
      "A  good  prepared  speech McLeish  thought with  not  a  word  of  truth  in  it\n",
      "In  fact he  realized she  had  simply  adopted  the  words  other  people  must  have  said  to  her  over  and  over  again\n",
      "He  wondered  whether  she  had  always  been  quite  so  uncaring  of  her  appearance  or  whether  it  had  been  grief  and  rage  at  Uncle  Bill 's  defection  that  had  started  this  off\n",
      "Not  a  very  easy  question  to  ask\n",
      "Were  you  close  to  your  uncle\n",
      "Till  she  came  along The  answer  was  like  a  rifle  shot full  of  pent-up  rage and  McLeish  sat  back\n",
      "You  felt  she  displaced  you  with  him I  mean\n",
      "Well she  had  all  the  advantages did n't  she\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley  was  destroying  the  remaining  cuticles  on  her  left  hand a  finger  pushed  savagely  against  her  teeth\n",
      "I  mean she  could  go  to  bed  with  him\n",
      "He  wanted  her and  he  was  getting  old  and  silly\n",
      "I  understand  that  he  was  sixty-two  when  he  died McLeish  said drily\n",
      "It 's  not  all  that  old\n",
      "He  was  idiotic  about  her\n",
      "Completely  OTT\n",
      "She  did n't  really  care  about  him  at  all she  just  wanted  his  money\n",
      "McLeish  decided  it  would  be  a  waste  of  time  to  suggest  that  it  would  have  hardly  been  reasonable  for  Angela  Morgan  to  expect  to  inherit  a  quick  fortune  from  a  man  of  sixty-two\n",
      "They  had  no  plans  to  marry then\n",
      "Of  course  not\n",
      "Or  she  did n't\n",
      "She  was  just  stringing  him  along\n",
      "Even  though  she  would  have  been  a  rich  woman  had  she  married  him\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley  looked  momentarily  disoriented but   any  recognition  that  a  valid  point  had  been  made  disappeared  and  she  went  back  to  chewing  her  cuticles\n",
      "You  now of  course come  into  possession  of  a  substantial  sum following  Miss  Morgan 's  death McLeish  observed sounding  as  accusing  as  he  could and  she  stopped  chewing  and  gave  him  her  full  attention\n",
      "Yes I  do\n",
      "Not  anything  like  it  would  have  been  if  Uncle  Bill  had  left  it  to  me  in  the  first  place because  it  will  pay  duty  twice\n",
      "But  more  than  you  would  have  got  if  Miss  Morgan  had  agreed  to  your  suggestion  of  splitting  the  fund  up  between  you\n",
      "How  did  you  know  about  that\n",
      "Solicitors I  suppose  if  it  was  mine  I 'll  find  new  ones\n",
      "She  glared  at  McLeish who  looked  deadpan\n",
      "Yes I  would n't  have  got  all  that  much but  she  would n't  even  agree  to  that greedy  cow\n",
      "The  sudden  descent  into  abuse  took  McLeish  by  surprise  and  he  realized  he  must  have  shown  it because  the  girl  literally  got  a  grip  on  herself folding  her  arms  and  hunching  over  the  table\n",
      "Well you 've  got  it  now he  said  crudely and  watched  with  fascination  as  the  corners  of  her  mouth  tucked  in  smugly\n",
      "I 'd  like  to  go  over  your  movements  with  you  for  last  Saturday Sunday  and  Monday  week please he  went  on  crisply\n",
      "Penelope  Huntley  looked  at  him  in  amazement with  dawning  understanding\n",
      "More  human  than  she 'd  looked  all  morning he  thought realizing  he  had  taken  against  his  witness  at  least  partly  because  she  was  alive  and  the  amusing lively feminine  creature  that  had  been  Angela  Morgan  was  not\n",
      "Uncle  Bill  had  been  a  wise  man  to  leave  the  money  to  Angela who  had  enjoyed  it rather  than  to  this  grudging bitter scruffy  young  woman\n",
      "I  did n't  kill  her if  that 's  what  you  mean\n",
      "I  thought  of  it  at  one  ti  me but  I  knew  I 'd  make  a  mess  of  it\n",
      "She  bit  savagely  at  her  cuticles  again and  McLeish  had  to  fight  back  the  urge  to  yell  at  her  to  stop for  God 's  sake\n",
      "Could  you  tell  us  where  you  were  and  what  you  were  doing  on  those  three  days please he  said instead levelly  and  she  gave  him  another  sideways calculating  look\n",
      "Including please names  and  addresses  of  anyone  you  spent  time  with he  added  pleasantly  and  saw  her  understand  that  he  was  serious  and  she  had  better  get  her  act  together\n",
      "It  seemed  to  take  an  unreasonably  long  time  and  much  bad  temper evasion  and  deliberate  obfuscation together  with  consultation  of  a  diary  that  appeared  to  be  alternately  blank  and  covered  with  scribbled  hieroglyphics\n",
      "And  the  narrative  extracted  with  such  difficulty  was  not  helpful\n",
      "Miss  Huntley  claimed  to  have  spent  the  Saturday  by  herself  in  and  around  her  flat doing  a  bit  of  shopping  and  cleaning  before  meeting  a  few  friends  only  one  of  whom  appeared  to  have  an  address  and  going  on  to  a  party  around  ten  o'clock  at  night\n",
      "A  large  party in  and  out  of  which  people  had  evidently  flowed  like  water  circulating  in  a  swimming  pool\n",
      "Sunday  was  not  much  better Miss  Huntley  had  not  risen  from  her  bed  until  one  p.m.  and  had  not  left  the  flat  until  five then  only  to  go  to  the  cinema\n",
      "On  Monday  she  had  gone  to  her  job  improbably  she  appeared  to  be  a  supervisor  for  a  market  research  firm  as  usual and  could  be  vouched  for  by  colleagues  there\n",
      "Well two  colleagues  anyway\n",
      "No she  did  not  own  a  car  could  not  afford  to  but  she  did  have  a  driving  licence\n",
      "Uncle  Bill  had  run  a  car  for  her  on  his  company  while  he  was  alive  but  of  course  that  had  all  stopped  when  he  died\n",
      "McLeish who  remembered  that  she  had  been  left  £200,000  outright received  this  as  further  evidence  that  the  young  woman  had  gone  into  a  massive  sulk  after  her  uncle 's  unexpected  death\n",
      "It  was  difficult  to  tell of  course whether  she  had  always  possessed  an  unattractive aggressive sullen  personality or  whether  rejection  by  her  uncle  in  favour  of  Angela  Morgan  had  tipped  her  over  into  this  behaviour\n",
      "Perhaps  she  would  brighten  up  now  that  she  had  another  substantial  amount  of  cash  to  spend\n",
      "He  asked  her  to  come  back  as  suited  her  to  sign  her  statement and  she  made  all  kinds  of  difficulties  about  when  this  would  be  possible\n",
      "He  finally  dealt  with  that  by  saying  briskly  that  one  of  his  staff  would  come  to  her  place  of  business\n",
      "She  opened  her  mouth  to  argue  further being  plainly  in  the  mood  to  announce  she  was  leaving  her  job   rather  than  allow  any  arrangement  to  succeed but  something  about  McLeish 's  expression  checked  her  and  she  agreed  meekly\n",
      "McLeish  saw  her  off  and  returned  to  confer  with  Catherine\n",
      "You  get  all  that\n",
      "It 'll  all  have  to  be  checked  you 've  got  Donalds  and  Ridley  to  do  that\n",
      "He  gazed  at  her  bent  head  as  she  read  through  her  notes and  she  looked  up  and  smiled  faintly  at  him\n",
      "Shall  I  do  it  now\n",
      "Not  yet\n",
      "What  did  you  think  of  Miss  Huntley\n",
      "What  a  bitch eh\n",
      "Catherine  considered  him  thoughtfully\n",
      "I  was  sorry  for  her\n",
      "Her  dad  died then  her  uncle  went  off  with  someone  else\n",
      "And  left  his  money  away  from  her\n",
      "I  had n't  quite  seen  it  like  that McLeish  acknowledged  humbly remembering  that  the  beautiful  woman  in  front  of  him whom  you  could  not  suppose  ever  to  have  encountered  rejection  in  any  form had  lost  a  father  when  young and  had  been  so  little  attached  to  her  stepfather  that  she  had  left  home  at  the  earliest  opportunity\n",
      "She  is  in  the  frame though he  suggested\n",
      "Oh  yes\n",
      "What  was  it  she  would  get  on  Angela  Morgan 's  death  about  £120,000  after  taxes\n",
      "And  I  suppose  she  feels  she 's  won\n",
      "I  mean  she 's  alive is n't  she\n",
      "McLeish  observed  soberly  that  £120,000  and  the  death  of  a  hated  rival  seemed  a  prize  well  worth  playing  for\n",
      "She 's  got  a  nasty  enough  temper  I  just  do n't  myself  see  her  as  clever  or  organized  enough  to  cover  her  tracks\n",
      "Well perhaps  you 'll  find  she  has n't  it 's  not  much  of  an  alibi is  it\n",
      "No\n",
      "Gaps  all  over  Saturday  and  Sunday  you  reckon  Angela  was  killed  then rather  than  Monday\n",
      "I  reckon  Saturday\n",
      "We 've  got  no  sighting  of  her  after  first  thing  Saturday  morning\n",
      "Catherine  Crane  looked  at  him  carefully and  he  grinned  at  her\n",
      "Come  on I  know  that  look  now\n",
      "What  am  I  missing\n",
      "She  blushed\n",
      "It 's  just  that  the  only  person  who  saw  her  on  Saturday  was  the  Minister  Mr  Hawick\n",
      "Why  would  he  be  lying\n",
      "Only  if  he  was  the  murderer  and  had  actually  killed  her  earlier\n",
      "McLeish  sighed\n",
      "I 'd  not  forgotten  him but  I  just  could n't  see  why  he 'd  want  to  kill  her\n",
      "He  did n't  get  any  of  her  money  if  she  died  before  they  were  married\n",
      "It  could  have  been  jealousy\n",
      "Mrs  Morgan  did  think  there  was or  had  been something  with  her  boss\n",
      "And  Mr  Hawick  did n't  seem  to  me  the  kind  of  chap  who 'd  put  up  with  that\n",
      "McLeish  nodded not  entirely  convinced but  unwilling  for  a  variety  of  reasons  to  discourage  Catherine\n",
      "We  need  to  check  what  he  was  doing  those  days anyway  I  did n't  try  too  hard  when  we  were  last  there because  I  hoped  the  autopsy  might  give  us  something\n",
      "As  it  did\n",
      "I 'll  get  Jenny  to  fix  it\n",
      "She  nodded and  he  sat  looking  at  her  until  she  looked  back  at  him\n",
      "He  glanced  up  at  the  spy-hole  and  grinned\n",
      "Let's  get  some  lunch\n",
      "I  ca n't  face  the  canteen  but  there 's  a  trattoria  round  the  corner\n",
      "I  never  see  anyone  from  this  place  there\n",
      "They  ate  in  the  small  crowded  Italian  restaurant  which  was as  he  had  promised free  of  their  New  Scotland  Yard  colleagues\n",
      "It  was  also  free  of  DTI  civil  servants  as  he  had  quietly  ascertained  while  they  waited  for  their  lunch  to  arrive\n",
      "They  walked  out  into  a  cold bright  day into  one  of  the  labyrinthine  streets  by  the  side  of  Westminster  Abbey straight  into  a  column  of  knickerbockered  children  chattering  hard  and  sweeping  all  before  them\n",
      "As  they  stood  patiently  in  a  doorway  waiting  for  the  column  to  pass Catherine  turned  to  say  something  to  McLeish  and  he  looked  down  at  her  for  a  long  moment\n",
      "Better  get  back\n",
      "Smiling  to  himself he  looked  idly  across  the  road  and  saw  Francesca who  should  not  have  been  back  till  Thursday\n",
      "She  was  not  looking  in  their  direction her  head  was  turned  to  say  something  to  whomever  she  was  with her  short  hair  blown  straight  up  by  the  wind  as  they  went  into  the  little  newsagent 's leaving  McLeish  a  clear  run  to  get  Catherine  back  to  the  Yard\n",
      "He  walked  heavily  beside  her trying  to  convince  himself  that  Francesca  had  not  seen  them\n",
      "But  she  had of  course  she  had that  was  why  she  had  fled\n",
      "He  got  back  to  his  own  desk  and  sat looking  at  his  hands unable  to  decide  whether  to  ring  her  up or  what  to  say\n"
